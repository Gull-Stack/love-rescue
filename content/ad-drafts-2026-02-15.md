## AD 1: "No Judgment" (Inspired by CoupleWork AI's 7-month runner)

**Primary Text (Long-form):**

Getting relationship help shouldn't feel like couples therapy.

You know the kind —
Where someone picks apart your words.
Where you leave feeling more blamed than helped.
Where "communication" means someone tells you what you did wrong.

You don't need that.

You need someone who actually gets it.
Someone who listens to BOTH sides.
Someone who focuses on solutions, not sides.

That's what LoveRescue was built for.

✅ AI-guided support that never takes sides
✅ Science-backed assessments that show YOUR patterns
✅ Daily strategies that fit in 5 minutes
✅ No judgment. No blame. Just progress.

Because real relationship help focuses on what works — not who's wrong.

Try it free today. Your relationship will thank you.

## AD 2: "Post-Valentine's Reality" (Timing: Feb 16-28 golden window)

**Primary Text (Story-style, inspired by Relatio's format):**

Valentine's Day is over.

The flowers are wilting on the counter.
The chocolate box is half-empty.
And that awkward silence from dinner? 
That's still here.

Here's what nobody tells you:

Valentine's Day doesn't create relationship problems.
It exposes the ones you've been avoiding.

The forced "date night" that felt like work.
The gift that missed the mark... again.
The way you both reached for your phones before dessert.

Those aren't Valentine's Day problems.
Those are PATTERN problems.

Patterns like:
→ Talking AT each other instead of WITH each other
→ Assuming instead of asking
→ Keeping score instead of building trust

The good news?

Every pattern has a solution.
You just need to see them first.

That's why we built LoveRescue.

10+ science-backed assessments that show you EXACTLY what's happening in your relationship.

Not generic advice.
Not "just communicate more."
YOUR specific patterns. YOUR specific solutions.

Because flowers die in a week.
But communication patterns last forever.

**Headline:** Valentine's Day Revealed the Cracks. We Help You Fill Them.

**Description:** Free relationship assessment. 5 minutes. Life-changing insights.

**CTA:** Take the Quiz

**Creative Direction:**
- 30-45 second video
- Open on wilting flowers, transition to couple looking at phones
- End on hopeful moment (couple talking, laughing)
- Text overlays matching the copy beats

**Target Audience:**
- 28-50, relationship status: In a relationship / Married
- Interest: Valentine's Day, relationships, self-improvement
- Timing: Feb 16-28 only

**Landing Page:** loverescue.app/quiz (Attachment Style assessment)
