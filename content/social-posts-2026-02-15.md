## POST 1: Post-Valentine's Reality Check (Instagram/TikTok Reel Script)

**Format:** 15-second talking head → text overlay

**Hook (0-3s):** "Valentine's Day just revealed something about your relationship..."

**Body:**
The flowers are dying. The chocolates are gone.
And that awkward silence at dinner? That's still here.

Valentine's Day doesn't create problems.
It exposes the ones you've been ignoring.

**CTA:** The good news? You can actually fix them. Link in bio.

## POST 2: The 6-Second Rule (Carousel or Single Static)

**Format:** Quote card or carousel

**Slide 1 (Hook):**
"Couples who stay together do ONE thing differently every single day."

**Slide 2:**
They kiss for 6 seconds before leaving the house.

Not a peck. Not a quick goodbye.
6 intentional seconds.

**Slide 3:**
Why?

Gottman's research shows a 6-second kiss is long enough to feel romantic — not routine.

It takes you from autopilot to present.

**Slide 4:**
Try it tomorrow morning.
Then try it for 7 days.

Watch what happens. 👀

## POST 3: The Real Reason Couples Fail (Thread/Caption)

**Format:** Long caption for Instagram or thread for X

**Copy:**

Most couples don't break up because they stopped loving each other.

They break up because they stopped UNDERSTANDING each other.

Here's what actually happens:

Week 1: "Why don't you ever listen to me?"
Week 4: "You never change."
Month 3: "We're just too different."
Month 6: Silence.

The problem was never love. It was:
→ Mismatched communication styles
→ Unspoken needs
→ Patterns nobody taught you to see

That's why we built assessments that actually show you what's happening.

Not generic advice. YOUR patterns. YOUR blind spots.

Link in bio if you're ready to see yours.

**Scene 2:** Person writing then deleting a text

**Scene 3:** Dramatic zoom on face
