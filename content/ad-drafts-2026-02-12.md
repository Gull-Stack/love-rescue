# Ad Creative Draft — 2026-02-12
*Modeled after longest-running competitor format: Lasting's structured assessment → transformation narrative*

## Ad: "The Relationship Score" (Meta — Reels + Feed)

### Why This Format
Lasting has run their "94% report new relationship strengths" proof-point ad for 6+ months — making it their longest-running concept. The format: **assessment entry → personalized insight → transformation claim → CTA.** We're adapting this with LoveRescue's superior assessment depth.

### Creative Spec
- **Format:** 25-second Reel (vertical 9:16) + static fallback (1:1)
- **Audience:** Broad (let Andromeda optimize) — women 25-45 primary
- **Objective:** App installs / Lead gen (quiz completion)
- **Budget Note:** Launch Feb 16 (post-V-Day CPM dip)

### Video Script

> TEXT OVERLAY: "We scored our relationship. Here's what happened."
>
