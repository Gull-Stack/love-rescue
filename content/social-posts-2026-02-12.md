## Post 2: "The Gym Metaphor" 💪
**Platform:** Instagram/TikTok (15s)
**Hook Style:** Reframe/analogy (modeled after Flamme's "gym for your relationship" positioning)
**Angle:** Destigmatize relationship work

**Script:**
> 🎬 [SPLIT SCREEN]
>
> LEFT: Person at gym, sweating, working hard
> TEXT: "Nobody thinks you're broken for going to the gym"
>
> RIGHT: Couple on couch looking at LoveRescue app
> TEXT: "So why would working on your relationship be any different?"
>
> [FULL SCREEN: App interface showing daily tracking + matchup scores]
>
> TEXT ON SCREEN: "Your relationship has muscles too. Train them."
>
> CTA: "Start free → LoveRescue"

**Caption:**
You don't go to the gym because you're broken. You go because you want to be stronger.

Same energy. LoveRescue gives you daily exercises backed by Gottman, attachment theory, and 6 more expert frameworks.

Not therapy. Training. 💪❤️

## Publishing Notes
- **Timing:** Post 1 on Feb 13 (pre-V-Day). Post 2 on Feb 16 (post-V-Day reflection window). Post 3 on Feb 19 (educational/evergreen).
- **Post-V-Day is the golden window** — CPMs drop but relationship intent stays high.
- All posts should link to assessment quiz landing page (needs to be built: loverescue.app/quiz).
