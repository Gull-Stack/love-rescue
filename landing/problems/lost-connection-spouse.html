    <h1>Lost Connection With Your Spouse? You're Not Broken. You're Human.</h1>
    <p>Why couples drift apart — and the science-backed path to reconnection.</p>
  </div>
  
  <article class="content">
    <p>You remember when it was easy. When you couldn't wait to see them. When conversation flowed and silence felt comfortable instead of heavy.</p>
    
    <p>Now? You're in the same house but different worlds. You talk about logistics — kids, schedules, bills — but not about <em>you</em>. The intimacy that once felt effortless now feels like work. Or worse: like something that's just... gone.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You're not alone.</strong> And this isn't the end.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Couples Lose Connection</h2>
    
    <p>Emotional disconnection doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow drift, caused by:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Life stress</strong> — Work, kids, finances consume all your energy</li>
      <li><strong>Missed bids</strong> — Small moments of connection get ignored</li>
      <li><strong>Unresolved hurt</strong> — Old wounds that never fully healed</li>
      <li><strong>Assumptions</strong> — Thinking you know everything about them (you don't)</li>
      <li><strong>Parallel lives</strong> — Existing together without actually connecting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>💡 The Science of Drifting Apart</h4>
      <p>Dr. John Gottman's research found that couples who stay connected "turn towards" each other's bids for attention 86% of the time. Couples who divorce? Only 33%. Connection is built in tiny moments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Signs You've Lost Connection</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>You feel lonely even when you're together</li>
      <li>Conversations stay surface-level</li>
      <li>Physical intimacy has declined or feels mechanical</li>
      <li>You find yourself seeking emotional fulfillment elsewhere</li>
      <li>You can't remember the last time you really laughed together</li>
      <li>Small annoyances feel bigger than they should</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Rebuild Connection</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Start Small</h3>
    <p>You don't need a grand gesture. Connection rebuilds through consistent small moments: a 6-second hug, a genuine question about their day, putting your phone down when they talk.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Rebuild Your "Love Maps"</h3>
    <p>Gottman's term for knowing your partner's inner world. When did you last ask about their dreams? Their worries? Their favorite memory from last month? Reconnection starts with curiosity.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Practice Vulnerability</h3>
    <p>Brené Brown's research shows that vulnerability is the birthplace of connection. Saying "I miss us" is scary — but it opens doors that staying silent never will.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Address the Unspoken</h3>
    <p>Often, disconnection is a symptom of deeper issues that haven't been named. Sue Johnson's work on attachment shows that beneath anger and distance is usually fear and longing.</p>

    <h2>The Truth About Reconnection</h2>
    
    <p>Here's what nobody tells you: <strong>most couples who feel disconnected still have love underneath.</strong> It's buried under stress, routine, and unspoken hurt — but it's there.</p>
    
    <p>Reconnection isn't about becoming a different couple. It's about finding your way back to each other. And with the right tools, it happens faster than you think.</p>
