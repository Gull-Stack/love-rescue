## TOP 10 PAIN POINTS (Ranked by Frequency/Severity)

### 1. 🔴 PRICE GOUGING & PRIVATE EQUITY GREED (CRITICAL)
- SimplePractice (owned by Vista Equity Partners) has been steadily raising prices — Starter plan jumped from $29 → $49 (69% increase) in Feb 2025
- Essential tier went from $69 → $79. Users report "charging more for less features"
- Reddit is FURIOUS: "SimplePractice was bought out by private equity and their MO is to cut costs"
- Therapists spending $400-$600/month total on tech stack (EHR + telehealth + AI notes + HIPAA email)
- **Current pricing landscape**: SimplePractice $49-$99/mo, TherapyNotes $59-$69/mo, TheraNest similar range

### 2. 🔴 BILLING & INSURANCE CLAIMS ARE A NIGHTMARE (CRITICAL)
- SimplePractice billing described as borderline "fraudulent" for supervisor billing scenarios
- Can't see which clients haven't been invoiced without checking each one individually
- Co-insurance percentages must be manually recalculated for every different CPT code
- Payment reports don't match actual cash received vs. pending insurance checks
- Payroll reconciliation is "completely trashed and wrong"
- **Quote from Reddit**: "The way they handle superbills, statements, and claims when billing under a supervisor borders on fraudulent"

### 3. 🔴 DOCUMENTATION BURDEN → BURNOUT (CRITICAL)
- **93% of behavioral health workers report burnout** (National Council)
- **78% self-reported burnout rate among psychiatrists**
- EHR usability scores: median SUS score of 45.9/100 — **bottom 9% of ALL software systems**
- Each 1-point drop in usability = 3% increase in burnout risk
- Staff vacancy rates exceed 40% in behavioral health — admin burden is leading cause
- Clinicians report documentation as "tasks less connected to meaning and purpose"
- AI note-taking tools like Freed ($90/mo/clinician) emerging as band-aid solutions

### 4. 🟠 CLIENT PORTAL IS CONFUSING (HIGH)
- Multiple Reddit threads: "the client portal confuses people"
- Client login flow described as "super clunky and archaic" — requiring link requests each time
- If client visits another provider's portal, session gets wiped
- Therapists embarrassed by the experience they're providing clients

### 5. 🟠 LOCKED IN / IMPOSSIBLE TO SWITCH (HIGH)
- Data export from SimplePractice described as so difficult "it just isn't worth it"
- Therapists stay with tools they hate because switching means migrating all client records
- **Quote**: "daily is rethinking [leaving] but finds that their program is so hard to export info to a new EHR"
- This is a deliberate moat — and it creates deep resentment

### 6. 🟠 TELEHEALTH IS UNRELIABLE (HIGH)
- "Telehealth always seems to act up right when I need it to be reliable"
- TheraNest charges $12/mo extra per therapist for telehealth
- Multiple platforms require separate telehealth subscriptions (Doxy.me, Zoom HIPAA, etc.)

### 7. 🟡 CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- SimplePractice had NO phone or email support — only a Facebook group
- Help guides "skip steps or are completely wrong sometimes or leave out key details"
- TherapyNotes gets better marks here — "responsive and helpful"
- **Quote**: "I don't want to reach out to customer services every time I have a question"

### 8. 🟡 FEATURES KEEP GETTING REMOVED/PAYWALLED (MEDIUM-HIGH)
- Calendar sync removed from basic tier (SimplePractice)
- "They asked 2000 clinicians if they like to pay more for things that should be included for free"
- Features that were previously included now require upgrading tiers
- Classic PE playbook: extract more from existing customers

### 9. 🟡 GROUP/COUPLES NOTES ARE TERRIBLE (MEDIUM)
- "The process for group notes was convoluted and frustrating"
- 4+ year old support request for better group notes — still unresolved
- No good way to track both partners in couples therapy
- Notes designed for individual therapy, shoehorned into relational work

### 10. 🟡 NO REAL OUTCOME TRACKING / MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE (MEDIUM)
- Less than 18% of psychiatrists, 11% of psychologists, and 14% of masters-level practitioners use MBC
- Only 5% use it at recommended frequency (every session)
- EHR systems "simply not designed to capture, manage and share this type of data"
- Lack of interoperability and data standardization

## TOP 10 FEATURES THERAPISTS WISH EXISTED

### 1. **AI-Powered Note Writing That Actually Works**
- Therapists want to focus on the client, not the keyboard
- Freed, Eleos, and others gaining traction — but at $90/mo+ and as separate tools
- Dream: session automatically generates a compliant note draft

### 2. **Billing That Doesn't Require an Accounting Degree**
- Auto-calculate co-insurance based on CPT codes
- Dashboard showing: "these clients haven't been invoiced" at a glance
- Real reconciliation: what's been paid vs. what's pending vs. what's owed

### 3. **One-Click Data Migration / No Vendor Lock-In**
- Therapists are trapped. They'd switch in a heartbeat if they could export easily
- Standardized export format that any EHR can import
- This is the #1 switching barrier

### 4. **Between-Session Client Engagement Tools**
- Homework assignments that clients actually complete
- Mood/symptom tracking between sessions
- Therapist visibility into the "other 167 hours"
- Currently patching with: Daylio, Gottman app, CBT Coach, worksheets — none integrated

### 5. **Outcome Tracking That's Actually Usable**
- Visual progress graphs that make sense to clinician AND client
- Auto-scored assessments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ORS, etc.)
- Trend lines showing improvement over time
- Sessions Health is doing some of this — but it's not standard

### 6. **A Client Portal That Doesn't Embarrass You**
- Modern, mobile-first design
- No login link required every time
- Intake forms that feel professional, not like a DMV form

### 7. **Reliable Built-In Telehealth**
- Not a $12/mo add-on, not a separate platform
- Video that "just works" without technical support calls
- Integrated with notes, scheduling, billing — seamlessly

### 8. **Flexible Note Templates for Different Modalities**
- SOAP, BIRP, DAP are standard — but no good templates for:
  - Couples/relational work (tracking both partners)
  - Group therapy
  - EFT/Gottman-specific frameworks
  - Play therapy, EMDR, etc.

### 9. **Smart Scheduling That Reduces No-Shows**
- Automated reminders that actually work
- Waitlist management
- Couples scheduling (coordinating TWO people's calendars)

### 10. **Practice Analytics / Business Intelligence**
- Revenue trends, session counts, cancellation rates
- "Am I actually making money?" dashboard
- Projected income based on scheduled sessions

## COUPLES THERAPY-SPECIFIC GAPS 🎯

This is where the BIGGEST opportunity lives. Every EHR is built for **individual therapy**. Couples therapists are forced to hack workarounds.

### Gap 1: No Way to Track Both Partners
- EHRs create ONE client record. Couples therapy has TWO clients.
- Workarounds: Create a "couple" as one client, or maintain separate records that don't connect
- No way to see Partner A's perspective alongside Partner B's
- No comparative tracking (is one partner improving while the other stagnates?)

### Gap 2: No Relationship Outcome Measures
- Individual measures (PHQ-9, GAD-7) don't capture relationship dynamics
- Gottman's measures exist but aren't integrated into any EHR
- No way to track: trust levels, communication quality, attachment security over time
- Couples therapists resort to paper forms or memory

### Gap 3: No Between-Session Engagement for Couples
- Couples see therapist 1 hour/week but conflict happens in the other 167 hours
- The Gottman Card Decks app exists but doesn't connect to the therapist
- No way to assign couple-specific homework and track completion
- No way for both partners to independently report on the week
- **Reddit quote from couples therapist**: "I'm always on the lookout for practical, easy-to-use resources to recommend that they can use in between sessions"

### Gap 4: No Interaction Pattern Tracking
- Core of couples work = identifying cycles (pursue-withdraw, attack-defend)
- No digital tool tracks these patterns over time
- Therapists rely on memory and handwritten notes
- No way to show couples their OWN pattern data ("look, this cycle happened 4 times this week")

### Gap 5: Notes Not Designed for Relational Work
- Group/couples note process described as "convoluted and frustrating" (4+ year old unresolved request)
- No way to document relational dynamics, only individual symptoms
- EFT stages, Gottman Sound Relationship House levels — no structured tracking
- Treatment plans are individual-focused, not relationship-focused

### Gap 6: Confidentiality Complexity
- Couples therapy has unique confidentiality concerns (individual disclosures within couples work)
- No EHR handles the "no secrets" vs. "limited confidentiality" policy well
- Individual check-ins need separate, secure documentation

## WHAT WOULD MAKE A THERAPIST SWITCH?

Based on Reddit threads and review analysis:

1. **Easy migration** — "If I could export my data painlessly, I'd leave tomorrow"
2. **Lower price for same/better features** — $29-49/mo sweet spot for solo practitioners
3. **Better billing** — The #1 functional complaint across all platforms
4. **A system that "feels good to use"** — Quote: "I always feel like I'm wrestling with it"
5. **Reliable telehealth included** — Not an add-on
6. **Actually responsive support** — Not a Facebook group
7. **Features that DON'T get removed** — Trust that the platform won't enshittify
8. **Modern client experience** — Therapists are embarrassed by their client portals
9. **AI note-writing** — This is becoming table stakes rapidly
10. **A company NOT owned by private equity** — Real, visceral anger at Vista Equity Partners

### The Switching Calculus:
> **Pain of staying** (price hikes + feature removal + poor UX) must exceed **Pain of switching** (data migration + learning curve + client disruption)
> 
> SimplePractice is systematically increasing the "pain of staying" through PE-driven extraction. The window is WIDE OPEN for a competitor that makes switching easy.

## PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What Therapists Currently Pay:
| Platform | Solo Price | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| SimplePractice Starter | $49/mo | Was $29, now $49 (Feb 2025) |
| SimplePractice Essential | $79/mo | Most common tier |
| SimplePractice Plus | $99/mo | Full features |
| TherapyNotes Solo | $59/mo | Simpler pricing, well-liked |
| TheraNest | ~$39-$60/mo | Varies by features |
| Sessions Health | ~$35-$50/mo | Growing alternative |
| Carepatron Plus | $9.50/mo | Ultra-budget option |

### Total Monthly Tech Spend (Solo Therapist):
- EHR: $49-99
- Telehealth add-on: $0-15
- AI note-taking: $0-90
- HIPAA email: $10-20
- Website: $15-30
- Payment processing fees: varies
- **Total: $100-$600/month**

### Price Sensitivity Insights:
- **Sweet spot: $49-79/month** for a comprehensive solution
- Therapists will NOT pay more for less — the SP price hike backlash proves this
- They WILL pay for genuine time savings (AI notes worth $90/mo to many)
- **Value equation**: If you save them 5+ hours/month of admin work, $79/mo is a no-brainer
- Budget-conscious therapists (new practices) gravitate toward $29-49 range
- **Key insight**: Therapists don't mind paying — they mind paying MORE for a WORSE experience

## THE "BETWEEN SESSION" PROBLEM 🕐

### The 167-Hour Blindspot
Therapists see couples 1 hour per week. That leaves **167 hours** where:
- Conflicts escalate without intervention
- Homework goes uncompleted (or "forgotten")
- Partners experience completely different realities of the same week
- Breakthroughs from therapy get buried under daily stress
- The therapist has ZERO visibility

### Current Band-Aid Solutions:
- **Gottman Card Decks app** — Free, popular, but no therapist connection
- **Paradym** — Emerging app for tracking emotional patterns
- **Daylio** — Mood tracking, individual-focused
- **Paper worksheets** — Most common, lowest completion rates
- **Text/email check-ins** — Not HIPAA compliant, creates boundary issues
- **Calmerry** — Has between-session tools but is a therapy PLATFORM, not a tool for existing therapists

### What's Missing:
1. **Both partners independently reporting** on the same week → therapist sees both perspectives
2. **Real-time pattern detection** — "You've had 3 high-conflict evenings this week, all triggered by [topic]"
3. **Homework accountability** — Did they actually practice the communication exercise?
4. **Escalation alerts** — If conflict severity spikes, therapist gets a heads-up before next session
5. **Session prep** — When client walks in, therapist already knows what happened that week
6. **Progress visualization** — Couples can SEE their improvement over weeks/months

### Why This Gap Exists:
- EHRs are built as **admin tools**, not **clinical tools**
- Between-session engagement is a different product category entirely
- HIPAA compliance makes client-facing apps complex
- No one has combined the therapist-side EHR with the client-side engagement
- Couples add 2x complexity (two users, two perspectives, confidentiality nuances)

## THE MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE GAP 📊

### The Statistics Are Damning:
- **<18% of psychiatrists** use measurement-based care
- **~11% of psychologists** use it
- **~14% of masters-level practitioners** use it
- **Only 5%** use it at the recommended frequency (every session)
- MBC improves outcomes significantly — but almost nobody does it

### Why Therapists Don't Track Outcomes (Despite Knowing They Should):

1. **"Measures are no better than clinical judgment"** — Practitioner-level belief (research proves this wrong — therapists fail to detect client deterioration without measures)
2. **Time burden** — Administering, scoring, reviewing adds to already-crushed schedules
3. **EHR integration doesn't exist** — Systems aren't designed for this data
4. **Lack of training** — Never taught MBC in grad school
5. **Confidentiality concerns** — Patients worry about how data will be used
6. **No reimbursement** — Insurance doesn't pay extra for MBC
7. **Competing requirements** — Already drowning in documentation requirements
8. **Poor interoperability** — Data can't be shared or standardized across systems
9. **Measures feel impersonal** — "I'm a relational therapist, not a data collector"
10. **No feedback loops** — Even when measures are collected, no system helps interpret or act on them

### The Opportunity:
> If you make MBC **invisible** (auto-collected, auto-scored, auto-visualized), therapists would use it. The barrier isn't willingness — it's workflow friction.

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY

### SimplePractice (Market Leader, ~250K users)
- **Strengths**: Brand recognition, comprehensive features, large user base
- **Weaknesses**: PE ownership (Vista Equity), rising prices, declining support, vendor lock-in
- **Vulnerability**: MASSIVE — therapists are actively looking to leave
- **Moat**: Data lock-in (hard to export)

### TherapyNotes
- **Strengths**: Better support, simpler pricing, strong documentation
- **Weaknesses**: Not client-friendly, rigid note formats, feels dated
- **Vulnerability**: Medium — respected but not loved

### TheraNest (now Ensora Health)
- **Strengths**: Customizable, good Wiley Planner integration
- **Weaknesses**: Small text boxes, telehealth costs extra, rebranding confusion
- **Vulnerability**: Medium — loyal but small user base

### Sessions Health (Emerging)
- **Strengths**: Auto-scored assessments, visual progress graphs, growing Reddit love

### Gap in Market: NO ONE is building specifically for couples therapy
- Every platform is individual-therapy-first
- Couples therapists are an underserved, high-value niche
- They have unique needs that NO current tool addresses well
- They're often higher-earning (couples sessions = higher rates)
- They're desperate for between-session engagement tools
