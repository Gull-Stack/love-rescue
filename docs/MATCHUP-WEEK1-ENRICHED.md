# Matchup Week 1: Foundation — "Building the Floor Before the Walls"

**Phase:** Foundation (Safety & Curiosity)
**Week Theme:** Establish safety rituals and genuine curiosity about each other's inner world
**Therapeutic Principle:** Nothing works until the nervous system feels safe. Week 1 is about creating the conditions for everything that follows.
**MIRROR Principle:** Every activity has two parts — (1) individual reflection, (2) shared exchange. Each person does their own work first, then brings it to the partnership.

## Day 1 (Monday): The Safety Inventory

**Title:** "What Makes Me Feel Safe With You"
**Duration:** 15 minutes (5 min solo + 10 min sharing)
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Expert:** Sue Johnson (Emotionally Focused Therapy)
**Why this expert:** Johnson's 30 years of research prove that emotional accessibility is the #1 predictor of relationship satisfaction. Before couples can grow, they need to know: "Are you there for me?"

### Why It Works
Your nervous system is constantly scanning: "Am I safe here?" When it detects safety, it shifts from self-protection to connection mode. Most couples skip this step — they jump straight into "fixing problems" while both partners' threat systems are still active. This exercise explicitly maps what safety looks and feels like for each of you, so you can intentionally create it.

### Specific Instructions
**Solo Phase (5 minutes each, separately):**
1. Write down 3 specific moments when you felt truly safe with your partner. Not "when we cuddle" — specific: "Last Tuesday when I told you I was stressed about work and you put your phone down and just listened."
2. Write down 1 thing your partner does that makes your body physically relax (a touch, a tone of voice, a phrase).
3. Write down 1 thing that makes you tense up — not to blame, but to inform. Frame it as: "My nervous system reacts when ___."

**Sharing Phase (10 minutes together):**
4. Take turns reading your safety moments aloud. The listener's only job: receive it. No defending, explaining, or minimizing. Just "Thank you for telling me that."
5. Share your physical safety signal. This becomes data you both can use.
6. Share your tension trigger gently. Frame: "This isn't about you being wrong — it's about helping you understand my wiring."

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Anxious + Avoidant pair:** The anxious partner may list many tension triggers. Cap at 1 for now — more vulnerability comes later when safety is established. The avoidant partner may struggle to identify safety moments; suggest they focus on physical sensations rather than emotions.
- **Anxious + Anxious pair:** Both may over-share. Set a timer. The goal is brief and specific, not exhaustive.
- **Avoidant + Avoidant pair:** This exercise may feel uncomfortable. Normalize that: "If this feels awkward, you're doing it right. Safety conversations are a skill, not a talent."
- **Secure + Any:** The secure partner models by going first and being specific.

## Day 2 (Tuesday): The Love Map Deep Dive

**Title:** "36 Things I Should Know About You (Starting With 3)"
**Duration:** 20 minutes (5 min solo + 15 min exchange)
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Expert:** John Gottman (Love Maps research)
**Why this expert:** Gottman's longitudinal studies of 3,000+ couples found that partners who maintain detailed "love maps" — mental models of each other's inner world — navigate stress, transitions, and conflict dramatically better. Love Maps are the foundation of the Sound Relationship House.

### Why It Works
Most couples think they know each other. Gottman's research shows a shocking gap: couples married 10+ years often can't name their partner's current biggest worry, best friend at work, or secret aspiration. Love Maps atrophy without maintenance. This exercise rebuilds them with low-stakes curiosity — no vulnerability required yet, just genuine interest.

### Specific Instructions
**Solo Phase (5 minutes):**
1. Without asking your partner, write your best guess to these 3 questions about THEM:
   - What's their biggest source of stress right now (not about your relationship)?
   - What's something they're secretly excited or hopeful about?
   - What's a small daily pleasure that makes their day better?
2. Rate your confidence in each answer: Sure / Probably / Guessing

**Sharing Phase (15 minutes):**
3. Exchange papers. Read your partner's guesses about you.
4. Score them: ✅ Nailed it / 🔶 Close / ❌ Missed it — and correct gently.
5. For every ❌, the guesser asks: "Tell me more about that." Listen for 2 minutes without interrupting.
6. End with: "What's one thing about your inner world right now that I'd never guess?"

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Anxious + Avoidant:** The anxious partner may interpret missed guesses as "you don't care." Preframe: "Misses aren't failures — they're invitations to update your map. The exercise IS the caring."
- **Avoidant + Any:** Avoidant partners may give short answers. The partner's job: ask ONE follow-up question, then accept whatever depth is offered. Don't push.
- **Both Anxious:** May turn this into a test. Remind: "This is an exploration game, not an exam."

## Day 3 (Wednesday): The Appreciation Audit

**Title:** "What I See That I Don't Say"
**Duration:** 10 minutes (5 min solo + 5 min exchange)
**Difficulty:** 1/5
**Expert:** John Gottman (Fondness & Admiration System)
**Why this expert:** Gottman found that the presence or absence of fondness and admiration is the single most reliable predictor of whether a relationship will survive. Couples who maintain an active habit of scanning for what's RIGHT about their partner are buffered against negativity. This is the antidote to contempt — the #1 relationship killer.

### Why It Works
Your brain has a negativity bias — it's wired to notice threats (including your partner's flaws) 5x more than positives. Deliberate appreciation practice literally rewires this. Neuroscience shows that gratitude activates the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate — areas associated with bonding and reward. In plain language: actively noticing what's good about your partner makes your brain enjoy being around them more.

### Specific Instructions
**Solo Phase (5 minutes):**
1. Write 3 specific appreciations about your partner from the LAST 48 HOURS. Rules:
   - Must be specific (not "you're great" but "you remembered to get my favorite coffee yesterday")
   - Must name the CHARACTER TRAIT underneath the action ("...and that shows me you're thoughtful")
   - Must include how it made you FEEL ("...it made me feel seen")
2. Format: "[Action] — this shows me you're [trait] — and it made me feel [emotion]"

**Sharing Phase (5 minutes):**
3. Read your 3 appreciations to your partner, making eye contact.
4. The listener receives with "Thank you" — nothing more. No deflecting ("Oh, that was nothing"), no reciprocating in the moment. Just receive.
5. Switch roles.

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Avoidant partners:** Receiving appreciation may trigger discomfort. This is normal — avoidant attachment makes positive attention feel unsafe. Practice staying present for just 30 seconds of eye contact. Build from there.
- **Anxious partners:** May over-qualify ("You did this BUT you also..."). Hard rule: no "buts" today. Appreciation only.
- **Both avoidant:** Written exchange is fine for Week 1. Read each other's notes. Verbal delivery is a Week 3+ goal.

## Day 4 (Thursday): The Bid Tracker

**Title:** "Catching the Small Stuff"
**Duration:** Throughout the day + 10 min evening review (5 min solo + 5 min sharing)
**Difficulty:** 3/5
**Expert:** John Gottman (Bids for Connection research)
**Why this expert:** Gottman discovered that relationships live or die in tiny moments he calls "bids" — any attempt by one partner to connect (a sigh, a comment, a touch, showing a meme). Couples who "turn toward" bids 86% of the time stay together. Those who turn toward only 33% divorce within 6 years. This is the most granular, actionable relationship metric that exists.

### Why It Works
Most couples think connection happens in big moments — dates, vacations, deep talks. Gottman's data says the opposite: it's built in micro-moments throughout the day. A bid is any reach for attention, affirmation, or affection. "Look at this sunset" is a bid. A sigh from the other room is a bid. Scrolling past without looking up is a "turn away." This exercise trains you to SEE bids you're currently missing.

### Specific Instructions
**During the Day:**
1. Each person carries a small note or phone note titled "Bids I Noticed Today"
2. Every time you notice your partner making a bid (verbal, physical, digital), log it:
   - What the bid was
   - How you responded: Turned Toward (engaged) / Turned Away (ignored/missed) / Turned Against (dismissed)
3. Also log bids YOU made and how your partner responded

**Evening Review (10 minutes):**
4. Solo (5 min): Count your totals. Calculate your "turn toward" percentage.
5. Together (5 min): Share your logs. Compare — did you notice bids the other person missed? Were there bids you didn't realize were bids?
6. Pick ONE type of bid you want to catch better tomorrow.

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Anxious partner:** May log excessive bids or interpret neutral moments as "turned away." Coach: only log clear, intentional reaches for connection.
- **Avoidant partner:** May make very few bids, or make them so subtly they're invisible. Their partner should ask: "Are there ways you reach for connection that I might be missing?" Avoidant bids are often acts of service or physical proximity without words.
- **Anxious + Avoidant:** This exercise is GOLD for this pair — it makes the invisible visible. The anxious partner sees that the avoidant IS reaching; the avoidant sees that their subtle bids need to be louder.

## Day 5 (Friday): The Curiosity Conversation

**Title:** "Tell Me Something I Don't Know"
**Duration:** 20 minutes (5 min solo prep + 15 min conversation)
**Difficulty:** 3/5
**Expert:** Esther Perel (Mating in Captivity, relational curiosity)
**Why this expert:** Perel's central insight: desire and long-term love require mystery. Not manufactured mystery — genuine curiosity about the OTHER as a separate, evolving person. Most couples stop being curious after the first year. Perel says the antidote to taking your partner for granted is treating them as someone you'll never fully know.

### Why It Works
Familiarity breeds assumptions. You think you know your partner — and that assumption kills curiosity, which kills desire, which kills connection. Perel's research shows that couples who maintain an active stance of curiosity ("I wonder what they think about that") report 40% higher relationship satisfaction. This exercise disrupts the assumption that you already know everything.

### Specific Instructions
**Solo Prep (5 minutes):**
1. Write down 3 questions you've NEVER asked your partner. Not logistics. Not complaints disguised as questions. Genuinely curious questions. Examples:
   - "What's a belief you held strongly 5 years ago that you've changed your mind about?"
   - "If you could master one skill overnight, what would it be and why?"
   - "What's something you admire about how your parents' relationship worked — or something you want to do completely differently?"
2. Pick the one that excites you most.

**Conversation Phase (15 minutes):**
3. Find a comfortable, device-free space. Sit facing each other (or side by side — whatever feels natural).
4. Partner A asks their question. Partner B answers for up to 5 minutes. Partner A's job: NO interrupting, NO relating it back to yourself, just follow-up questions that go deeper.
5. Switch.
6. Close with: "What surprised you about what you just heard?"

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Avoidant partner preparing questions:** May default to safe/intellectual questions. Challenge: pick at least one that's emotionally layered (about values, fears, dreams — not facts).
- **Anxious partner listening:** May struggle not to relate everything back to the relationship. Reminder: this is about knowing your partner as a PERSON, not evaluating the relationship.
- **Both avoidant:** Doing this side-by-side (walking, driving) rather than face-to-face reduces intensity and allows deeper sharing.

## Day 6 (Saturday): The Co-Regulation Practice

**Title:** "Syncing Your Nervous Systems"
**Duration:** 15 minutes together
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Expert:** Stan Tatkin (Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy — PACT)
**Why this expert:** Tatkin's research demonstrates that partners literally regulate each other's nervous systems. Your heart rate, cortisol, and breathing patterns sync with your partner's — for better or worse. Couples who deliberately practice co-regulation build a shared physiological baseline of safety that makes conflict less destructive and recovery faster.

### Why It Works
Your autonomic nervous system doesn't distinguish between physical threat and relational threat. When your partner is stressed, YOUR body responds too. Co-regulation exercises teach your nervous systems to calm down TOGETHER, creating a shared experience of "we can handle hard things." Tatkin calls your partner "your psychobiological regulator" — this exercise makes that regulation intentional rather than accidental.

### Specific Instructions
**Together (15 minutes):**

**Part 1 — Synchronized Breathing (5 min):**
1. Sit facing each other, knees touching or close.
2. One partner places hand on the other's chest. Switch halfway.
3. Breathe together: 4 counts in, 7 counts hold, 8 counts out. The person with their hand on the other's chest sets the pace.
4. After 5 minutes, notice: does your body feel different than when you started?

**Part 2 — The 6-Second Hold (2 min):**
5. Stand and hold each other in a full embrace.
6. Hold for at least 6 seconds — long enough for both bodies to relax into it. You'll feel the shift: shoulders drop, breathing deepens.
7. Tatkin's rule: hold until you BOTH relax, not just one of you.

**Part 3 — Reflection (8 min):**
8. Separately write one sentence: "My body felt ___ before, and now it feels ___."
9. Share. Discuss: "When do we need this most during the week? Can we build it in?"

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Avoidant partner:** Extended physical contact may trigger a pull-away instinct. Start with the breathing only (hands on knees, not chest). Add the hold in Week 2 or 3 when it feels less loaded.
- **Anxious partner:** May want to extend this indefinitely. Set the timer. The boundary IS part of the safety: "We do this for 15 minutes, and it's enough."
- **Avoidant + Avoidant:** Side-by-side breathing (shoulders touching) may be more comfortable than face-to-face. The goal is nervous system sync, not intensity.
- **Anxious + Anxious:** May both over-process during reflection. Limit to ONE sentence each. Brevity is the practice.

## Day 7 (Sunday): The Weekly Map

**Title:** "Where We Are, Where We're Going"
**Duration:** 20 minutes (5 min solo + 15 min together)
**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Expert:** Gottman (State of the Union) + Perel (quality of conversations)
**Why these experts:** Gottman's "State of the Union" meeting is a structured weekly check-in that prevents small issues from becoming resentments. Perel adds the lens of quality: "The quality of your relationships is determined by the quality of your conversations about them." Together: structured honesty + genuine curiosity = a relationship that self-corrects.

### Why It Works
Most relationship problems don't explode — they accumulate. A missed bid here, an unspoken need there, a small hurt that never got acknowledged. Weekly reflection creates a pressure valve: nothing builds up past 7 days. It also creates a shared narrative — "this is OUR story of this week" — which Gottman identifies as a key component of Shared Meaning.

### Specific Instructions
**Solo Phase (5 minutes):**
1. Write brief answers to these 4 prompts:
   - **Highlight:** The best moment between us this week was ___
   - **Gratitude:** Something my partner did that I want to acknowledge: ___
   - **Need:** Something I needed more of (or less of) this week: ___
   - **Curiosity:** Something I want to understand better about my partner: ___

**Together Phase (15 minutes):**
2. Share highlights and gratitudes first (positive → negative ratio). Receive each one with "Thank you."
3. Share needs gently. Frame as requests, not complaints: "I'd love more of ___" not "You didn't ___."
4. Ask your curiosity question. Listen.
5. Close with ONE specific intention for next week: "Next week, I want us to ___."

### Attachment Style Adaptations
- **Anxious partner sharing needs:** May list many. Pick the ONE most important. The avoidant partner can hear one clearly; a list feels like an avalanche.
- **Avoidant partner sharing needs:** May say "I'm fine, no needs." Gently challenge: "If you could wave a magic wand and change one small thing about our week, what would it be?" Everyone has needs; avoidant partners just learned to suppress them.
- **Both anxious:** Structure is your friend. Stick to the format rigidly — it prevents the conversation from spiraling.
- **Both avoidant:** May rush through this. Set a minimum of 15 minutes. Silence is allowed; ending early isn't.

## Week 1 Goals

| Goal | Measurable Target | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Complete all 7 daily activities | 7/7 days | Consistency signals commitment to each other. Showing up daily is itself an act of love. |
| Build initial Love Maps | Each partner learns 3+ new things about the other's inner world | Gottman: strong Love Maps are the foundation of the Sound Relationship House. You can't love someone you don't know. |
| Establish a co-regulation ritual | Practice synchronized breathing or 6-second hold at least 2x this week | Tatkin: deliberate co-regulation builds a physiological foundation of safety that makes all future work possible. |
| Track bids for connection | Each partner logs bids for at least 1 full day | Gottman: awareness of bids is the first step to increasing turn-toward rate — the strongest micro-predictor of relationship longevity. |
| Maintain 5:1 positive ratio | Log at least 5 positive interactions per day | Gottman's "magic ratio": couples who maintain 5:1 positive-to-negative during conflict stay together 94% of the time. |

## Implementation Notes

### Data Model Additions Needed
Each activity should store:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "duration_minutes": "number",
  "difficulty": "number (1-5)",
  "expert": "string",
  "expert_rationale": "string",
  "why_it_works": "string (2-3 sentences)",
  "instructions_solo": ["step 1", "step 2"],
  "instructions_shared": ["step 1", "step 2"],
  "adaptation_notes": {
    "anxious_avoidant": "string",
    "anxious_anxious": "string",
    "avoidant_avoidant": "string",
    "secure_any": "string"
  },
  "phase": "foundation",
  "week": 1,
  "day": 1
}
```

### Progressive Difficulty Map (Weeks 1-6)
- **Week 1 (Foundation):** Safety, curiosity, appreciation — difficulty 1-3
- **Week 2 (Awareness):** Emotional patterns, communication habits — difficulty 2-3
- **Week 3 (Skills):** Conflict repair, emotional regulation, bid responsiveness — difficulty 3-4
- **Week 4 (Vulnerability):** Sharing fears, mapping cycles, attachment conversations — difficulty 3-4
- **Week 5 (Growth):** Supporting dreams, challenging patterns, identity shifts — difficulty 4-5
- **Week 6 (Integration):** Ritual creation, shared meaning, recommitment — difficulty 3-4

### MIRROR Principle Enforcement
Every activity MUST have:
1. A solo component (reflection, writing, observation)
2. A sharing component (structured exchange, not free-form)
3. A receiving protocol (how the listener should respond)

This prevents the common failure mode where one partner dominates and the other appeases.
