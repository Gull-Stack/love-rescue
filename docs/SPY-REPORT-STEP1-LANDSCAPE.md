- **Therapist Workflow**: Get matched with clients → weekly live session → between-session messaging → assign worksheets → group webinar options.
- **Client Progress Visibility**: Worksheets (therapist can assign and review), messaging, group session participation.
- **Couples Therapy Support**: **Yes — via Regain** (separate platform for couples). Same infrastructure.
- **Biggest Strength**: Massive scale, worksheet/homework tools (rare among platforms!), group therapy options
- **Biggest Weakness**: Low therapist pay, corporate control, privacy controversies, therapists are replaceable
- **🔴 KEY INSIGHT**: BetterHelp's worksheets feature shows that between-session engagement tools increase retention. But therapists hate the platform economics.

## 9. GAP ANALYSIS — WHERE THE MARKET FALLS SHORT

### 🔴 THE MASSIVE GAP: Between-Session Engagement for Couples Therapy

| What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---|
| Practice management (scheduling, billing, notes) | Between-session client engagement tools |
| One-time couples assessments (Gottman, Prepare/Enrich) | Ongoing couples progress tracking |
| AI chatbots (consumer-facing, no therapist connection) | Therapist-connected homework/exercise platform |
| Outcome measures (individual PHQ-9, GAD-7) | Couples-specific outcome measures in digital platform |
| Consumer couples apps (Couply, Lasting) | Therapist-facing dashboard showing couples' between-session activity |

### Key Findings:

1. **NO platform connects couples therapy homework to the therapist in real-time.** Couply/Lasting are consumer apps with no therapist dashboard. Gottman/Prepare-Enrich are one-shot assessments.

2. **MBC tools (Blueprint, Greenspace, Mirah) focus on individual therapy** — PHQ-9, GAD-7, OQ-45. No couples-specific measurement-based care platform exists.

3. **The "between sessions" space is wide open.** BetterHelp's worksheets prove therapists want this. But no independent tool does it well, especially for couples.

4. **AI documentation is becoming commoditized** — free AI notes are available (Upheal). The differentiator will be clinical INSIGHT, not just transcription.

5. **Woebot's shutdown proves** standalone consumer mental health tools fail. The winning model connects AI/digital tools BACK to the therapist.

6. **OurRitual proves the model** — sessions + between-session tools works. But it's vertically integrated, not a tool for independent therapists.

7. **Every couples assessment tool (Gottman, Prepare/Enrich, RELATE) is a one-time assessment** with no ongoing engagement layer. The technology is 20+ years old.

### The Unicorn Gap:
**A platform that gives couples therapists:**
- ✅ Between-session exercises/homework delivery
- ✅ Real-time visibility into couple's engagement
- ✅ Ongoing couples-specific outcome measurement
- ✅ AI-powered clinical insights from between-session data
- ✅ Integration with existing PM tools (SimplePractice, TherapyNotes)
- ✅ Gottman/EFT/attachment-theory aligned content

**This product does not exist.** The closest attempts (Couply, Lasting) fail on therapist integration. The closest MBC tools (Blueprint, Greenspace) fail on couples specificity.
