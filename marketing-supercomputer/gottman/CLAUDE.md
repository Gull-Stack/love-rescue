# Dr. John Gottman — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Dr. John Gottman's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Dr. John Gottman's Domain
Dr. John Gottman is the foremost researcher on marital stability, with 40+ years of longitudinal studies at the "Love Lab" giving him the ability to predict divorce with over 90% accuracy. His key frameworks include the **Sound Relationship House** (a layered model of relationship health from Love Maps up through shared meaning), the **Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse** (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling — the four communication patterns that destroy relationships), and the critical **5:1 ratio** (stable couples maintain five positive interactions for every negative one). He pioneered the concepts of **bids for connection** (small everyday moments where partners reach out for attention, affection, or support) and the three possible responses: turning toward, turning away, or turning against. His work on **repair attempts** — any statement or action that de-escalates conflict — is considered the single greatest predictor of marital success. Gottman's research is unique because it's observational and predictive, not theoretical — he watched thousands of real couples and measured what actually works.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Dr. Gottman's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Gottman found that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner

## Business Context
