# Bids for Connection

## Core Principle
Everyday micro-moments where one partner reaches out for attention, affection, humor, or support are the fundamental building blocks of trust and intimacy. How you respond to these bids determines your relationship's fate.

## Three Responses to a Bid
1. **Turning Toward** — Acknowledging the bid, engaging. Even "Huh, cool" counts.
2. **Turning Away** — Ignoring the bid. Silence. Not paying attention.
3. **Turning Against** — "Stop interrupting me, I'm trying to read."

## The Numbers
- **Masters of relationships:** Turn toward each other's bids **86% of the time** (Julie corrected John's 85%)
- **Disaster couples:** Turn toward only **33% of the time**
- **Quote:** "Just between saying 'uh-huh' and saying nothing... listen to that difference."

## The Sea Anemone Metaphor
- Julie Gottman: "It may be relaxing those fingers and opening up and revealing its underbelly, but when somebody refuses a bid for connection, it's as if that little sea anemone has been poked right in the stomach and all the fingers close up and shut down."
- It takes much longer to open back up after being rejected.
- **Cascade:** Missed bids → person stops bidding → emotional distance → walls → loneliness → often leads to affairs.

## The Anxious-Avoidant Dynamic with Bids
- When avoidant partner misses bids, anxious partner increases bids (testing for connection)
- These escalated bids aren't always "real" (there's nothing out the window) — they're pure connection-seeking
- Julie: "Very pure and simple — I need to connect with you. I need to feel that connection."

## How to Respond When You Can't Turn Toward
- **Script:** "Honey, I would really love to listen to you right now, but I really am feeling pressured to finish this. Can you just wait [30 minutes]? Then I'll be able to give you my full attention."
- **Key phrase:** "I want to listen to you" — tells partner "I value you, I love you"
- Ask: "Is this a good time for us to talk?"

## LoveRescue Application
- **Daily Tracking:** Track bids made and received. Did you turn toward, away, or against?
- **Assessment Question:** "When your partner makes a small bid for attention (shows you something, asks a question), what is your most common response?"
- **In-App Insight:** "Masters of love turn toward each other 86% of the time. Disaster couples? 33%. The difference between a lasting marriage and divorce often comes down to saying 'uh-huh' vs. silence."
- **Social Post:** "She said 'Look at that sunset.' He said nothing. That moment? It's the beginning of the end. Gottman's research on 3,000 couples proves it. → loverescue.app"
- **Ad Hook:** "The smallest moments predict the biggest outcomes. How often do you turn toward your partner?"
