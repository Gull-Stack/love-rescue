# Love & Health (Social Epidemiology)

## Core Principle
The quality of your closest relationships is one of the strongest predictors of longevity, immune function, and overall health. Bad relationships don't just make you sad — they make you sick and shorten your life.

## The Research
- **Alameda County Study** (Leonard Syme, Lisa Berkman): 9,000 people — quality of closest relationships predicted longevity powerfully
- Chinese American immigrants lived longer — not because of diet, but because of community and connection
- Socially isolated people with bad relationships get sick and die younger — across the entire planet
- People with great relationships live longer with better quality of life
- **Divorce impact:** Children of divorce live 4 years less on average. Children of divorce who themselves divorce live 8 years less.

## The Stress Hormone Connection
- Bad relationships → cortisol + adrenaline flooding → chronic stress → immune suppression
- Good relationships → oxytocin + serotonin → calm, bonding, healing
- Even reaching out to strangers affects health and longevity
