# Repair Attempts

## Core Principle
Repair attempts — any statement or action that de-escalates conflict — are the single greatest predictor of marital success. Not avoiding conflict, but repairing it mid-flight and afterwards.

## What Works vs. What Fails
### FAILS (Business meeting style):
- "Let's take a look at our options and evaluate them"
- "What are our priorities here?"
- "Let's be rational about this"
- "Let's evaluate the costs of one option versus another"

### WORKS (Emotion-focused):
- "I'm sorry I said that. Let me try again."
- "I'm really starting to feel defensive. Could you say that in a gentler way?"
- Focus on EMOTION, not logic
- The earlier in the conversation, the more effective

## Quote
"Any thing that you would do in a business meeting will fail in a love relationship."

## The 5-Step Regrettable Incident Method
For repairing AFTER a bad argument:
1. **Name your emotions** — each person identifies what they felt (from a printed list)
2. **Describe your perspective** — narrate what happened using "I felt / I saw / I heard / I imagined" (partner takes notes, summarizes, validates)
3. **Identify triggers** — did feelings from BEFORE this relationship get triggered? Share the enduring vulnerability and where it started
4. **Take responsibility** — state your state of mind, what you regret saying/doing, apologize (note: apology comes LATE because you need to understand impact first)
5. **One constructive step** — each person names one thing they'll do differently next time

## The Notebook Method (John's Secret Weapon)
- Carry a notebook. When partner needs to talk, pull it out and take notes.
- Writing calms you down — moves processing from amygdala to prefrontal cortex
- Makes partner feel valued: "What I'm saying is worth noting down"
- Quote: "I one time filled up an entire yellow pad."
