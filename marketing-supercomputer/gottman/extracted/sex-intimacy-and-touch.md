# Sex, Intimacy & Touch

## Core Principle
Physical touch, cuddling, and emotional connection are the foundation of a great sex life — not novelty or mystery. Familiarity creates more passion in the long run. Every positive thing you do in a relationship is foreplay.

## Key Findings
- **96% of non-cuddlers had an awful sex life** (from 70,000-person study across 24 countries)
- The 6-second kiss triggers oxytocin release → bonding, safety, arousal
- Men who kiss their wives goodbye live 4 years longer
- Couples who TALK about sex have better sex (structured conversations > hoping it works out)

## The Familiarity vs. Novelty Myth
- **MYTH:** Eroticism requires novelty, mystery, spontaneity
- **REALITY:** "The familiarity, the emotional connection, really knowing your partner creates in the long run much more passion, much better sex."
- Emily Nagoski's research (Come As You Are) confirms this

## Women Need Safety for Eroticism
- Women have more prerequisites for eroticism than men
- Women need: psychological safety, emotional connection, life logistics handled (to-do list managed)
- 1 in 4 women sexually assaulted by age 18 (likely 1 in 3 including unreported)
- Thousands of years of epigenetic trauma → inbuilt need for safety
- **Quote:** "Women need to feel psychologically safe... if you're very tense and uptight, milk isn't going to come down at all."

## The Hyper-Masculine Trap
- Some men reject cuddling as "too infantile"
- Only accept physical contact through penetrative sex
- Actually they need TOUCH — cuddling is just as masculine
- When they can accept cuddling, the whole dynamic improves
