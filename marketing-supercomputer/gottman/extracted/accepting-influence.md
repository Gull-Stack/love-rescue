# Accepting Influence

## Core Principle
"The only way to be powerful in a relationship is to accept influence." The most counterintuitive finding from 50 years of research — flexibility and listening create real power, not dominance.

## The Research
- Couples where one partner (often men) refused to accept influence from the other had an 81% chance of divorce
- Accepting influence = being flexible, movable, listening to your partner and letting their perspective genuinely shift your thinking
- This is NOT giving in or being passive — it's strength through openness

## Quote
"The most amazing one is that the only way to be powerful in a relationship is to accept influence. And it's so counterintuitive."

## Why Men Struggle More
- 80% of the time, women bring up problems (socialized as relationship caretakers)
- Men often interpret this as criticism rather than care
- The man who said "If she never raised an issue, there'd never be an issue" — Gottman's response: those issues made the relationship better
- Women are the "caretakers" of the relationship — bringing up issues IS an act of love

## The Hero Example
- A lawyer on the videotapes helped his WIFE identify what about his personality made her angry
- "Is it the way I talk? Like the king has spoken?" — "Yes" — "Well, that makes sense."
- He never got defensive. "Tell me more."
