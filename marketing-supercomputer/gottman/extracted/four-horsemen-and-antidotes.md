# The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse & Their Antidotes

## Core Principle
Four specific negative communication patterns predict relationship failure with over 90% accuracy: Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, and Stonewalling. Each has a research-backed antidote.

## The Four Horsemen

### 1. Criticism
- **What it is:** Attacking your partner's character instead of addressing a specific behavior. "You always..." / "You never..."
- **Quote:** "Criticism attacks the character of the recipient instead of focusing on a specific behavior."
- **Antidote:** Use "I" statements + express a positive need. "I feel [emotion] about [situation] and I need [positive need]."

### 2. Contempt
- **What it is:** Expression of superiority — sarcasm, cynicism, name-calling, eye-rolling, sneering, mockery, hostile humor.
- **Quote:** "Contempt is the greatest predictor of relationship failure and must be eliminated."
- **Why it's the worst:** It communicates disgust and superiority. "I'm better than you."
- **Antidote:** Build a culture of appreciation. Treat your partner with respect. Express fondness and admiration regularly.

### 3. Defensiveness
- **What it is:** Self-protection through righteous indignation or playing the victim. An underhanded way of blaming your partner.
- **Quote:** "Defensiveness never solves the problem and is really just an underhanded way of blaming your partner."
- **Antidote:** Accept responsibility, even if only for part of the conflict. "You're right, I did contribute to this."

### 4. Stonewalling
- **What it is:** The listener withdraws from conversation — no nodding, no facial movement, no vocalizations. Just shuts down.
- **Quote:** "85% of the time guys would stonewall... when we found those people's physiology is really elevated."
- **Why it happens:** Physiological flooding. The body goes into fight-or-flight. Men are more prone due to vasopressin (vs. women's oxytocin).
- **Antidote:** Take a break for at least 20 minutes (max 24 hours). Say "I need a break" (not "YOU need to stop"). State when you'll return. Don't rehearse your rebuttal — do something soothing. Come back at the designated time.

## Underlying Psychology
- Men secrete vasopressin → heightened arousal, takes longer to calm down, default to anger/aggression → they stonewall to self-regulate
- Women secrete oxytocin → can self-soothe faster, but ALSO flood when things escalate
- Flooding = cortisol + adrenaline → can't take in new info, can't listen, can't problem-solve, peripheral vision compromised
