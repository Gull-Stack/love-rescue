# Rituals of Connection

## Core Principle
Small, structured daily rituals of connection are the architecture of lasting love. They prevent emotional drift and build the friendship that sustains passion over decades.

## Examples from the Gottmans
- **Morning check-in:** "What's on your plate today? What does your day look like?"
- **Dinner ritual:** "How was your day? How did that session go?"
- **Weekly:** "What can I do this week to make you feel more loved?"
- **The 6-second kiss:** Lasts at least 6 seconds → triggers oxytocin release (same as 20-second hug). Creates bonding, safety, connection.
- **Annual honeymoon:** 23 years running. Three questions: "What sucked this year? What did you like? What do you want next year to be like?"
- **Expressing Needs card deck:** Once a week, share 2 things you need this week

## The Power of the Goodbye Kiss
- German 10-year study: Men who kiss their wives goodbye when leaving for work live 4 years longer than men who don't
- A parting kiss = connection ritual that sets the emotional tone for the day

## Quote
"Rather than leaving it to chance, you know — you're a man that loves maths."

## Fun Has Died
- 80% of the 40,000 couples studied said fun had come to die in the relationship
- It's not just sex that shuts down — it's play, adventure, exploration, laughter, novelty
- Rituals combat this by building intentional connection back in
