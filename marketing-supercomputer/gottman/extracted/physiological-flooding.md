# Physiological Flooding

## Core Principle
When stress hormones (cortisol + adrenaline) flood the body during conflict, you literally CANNOT listen, problem-solve, or empathize. Your nervous system hijacks your brain. The #1 skill is recognizing flooding and taking a structured break.

## What Happens When You're Flooded
- Can't take in new information
- Rely on overlearned habits (aggression or flight)
- Hearing is compromised
- Peripheral vision is compromised
- Focus only on cues to survive the moment
- Not a creative problem solver
- Repeat yourself, get more strident

## Gender Differences
- **Men:** Secrete vasopressin → more easily aroused, takes longer to calm, default to anger/aggression. 85% of stonewallers are men.
- **Women:** Secrete oxytocin → better at self-soothing (evolutionary: needed for milk letdown response for breastfeeding). But women ALSO flood and when they do, same inability to listen.
- **Quote:** "Through Evolution, men have been the protectors... men's bodies are really built to stay vigilant and hypervigilant especially for attack. That attack doesn't have to be physical — it can be mental, emotional, verbal."

## The Structured Break Protocol
1. Say "**I** need a take a break" (not "YOU need to stop")
2. State when you'll come back to continue
3. Go apart for 30 min to 1 hour (maximum 24 hours)
4. **DO NOT** think about the fight or plan your rebuttal — this keeps you flooded
5. Do something soothing: read, exercise, go for a walk, check email
6. **DO NOT** watch anything violent or stressful
7. Return at the designated time and continue the conversation

## "Never Go to Bed Angry" — MYTH
- St. Paul started this advice — "and he wasn't married"
- If it's late and you're flooded, go to bed. Give a quick kiss, shake hands, sleep.
- A terrible night's sleep makes everything worse

## LoveRescue Application
- **Assessment:** "How quickly do you reach physiological flooding during arguments? What are your body's signals?" (sweaty palms, racing heart, jaw clenching)
- **Daily Practice:** Learn your flooding signals. Practice the break protocol.
- **In-App Insight:** "When your heart rate exceeds 100 BPM during an argument, your body has entered fight-or-flight. You literally cannot hear your partner. The science says: take a break, not because you're weak — because you're human."
- **Social Post:** "Going to bed angry? Gottman says DO IT. A rested brain tomorrow beats a flooded brain at midnight. → loverescue.app"
