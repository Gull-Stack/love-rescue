# The Sound Relationship House

## Core Principle
Gottman's complete model of relationship health, built in layers like a house. Each level supports the ones above it. The foundation must be solid before the upper floors work.

## The Layers (Bottom to Top)
1. **Build Love Maps** — Know your partner's inner world (open-ended questions, curiosity)
2. **Share Fondness & Admiration** — Express appreciation, affection, respect. Touch is incredibly important.
3. **Turn Toward** — Respond to bids for connection (86% threshold for masters)
4. **The Positive Perspective** — When the first three are strong, you give your partner the benefit of the doubt
5. **Manage Conflict** — Use the Four Horsemen antidotes, repair attempts, accept influence
6. **Make Life Dreams Come True** — Honor each other's dreams (they don't need to align)
7. **Create Shared Meaning** — Rituals, roles, goals, symbols that give your relationship a sense of purpose

## Weight-Bearing Walls
- **Trust** — "Will you be there for me?" in ALL kinds of situations (sick, depressed, celebrating, frustrated). Nobody's perfect, but the more the better.
- **Commitment** — "This relationship is my journey for life. Not for the next three weeks."

## Key Quotes
- "You can feel love, and if you don't tell your partner you love them or express it with touch, which is incredibly important, then your partner may not be all that sure that you still do love them 5 years down the road."
- "The only way to be powerful in a relationship is to accept influence." (Most counterintuitive finding)

## Dreams Don't Have to Align
- "That's one of the big myths of all time — you have to be compatible, have the same dreams, same passions, same interests. Wrong, wrong, wrong."
- Often attracted to people who are DIFFERENT
- Support the dream, even if you don't share it

## LoveRescue Application
- **Assessment:** Sound Relationship House assessment — rate each level 1-10
- **Curriculum:** Each phase of the 16-week curriculum maps to levels of the house (Foundation = Love Maps + Fondness; Communication = Turning Toward + Conflict; etc.)
- **In-App Visualization:** Show the house with each level's health status — cracks in the foundation are visible
- **Social Post:** "Your relationship is a house. If the foundation (friendship) is cracked, no amount of conflict resolution at the top will save it. Build from the bottom. → loverescue.app"
