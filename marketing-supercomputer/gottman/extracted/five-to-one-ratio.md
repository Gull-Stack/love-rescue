# The 5:1 (Magic) Ratio

## Core Principle
Stable, happy relationships maintain a ratio of at least 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative interaction — even DURING conflict. This is a universal law of relationship health.

## The Research
- Measured second-by-second during conflict discussions
- Positive: interest, curiosity, affection, humor, validation, listening, "tell me more," "good point"
- Negative: anger, disappointment, hurt, criticism, defensiveness, belligerence, hostility
- **Masters:** 5:1 or higher (even during fights)
- **Disasters:** 0.8:1 (nearly equal negative to positive)

## Quote
"If you take the number of seconds they're displaying interest, curiosity, affection, humor... and divide that by the number of seconds that they're angry, upset, disappointed, hurt, critical, defensive... that ratio was 5 to 1 or higher among relationships that work well. During conflict."

## Why It Works
- The emotional bank account must have deposits to absorb withdrawals
- One negative interaction has roughly 5x the emotional impact of a positive one
- This is why "mostly good with a few bad moments" isn't enough — you need VASTLY more positive
