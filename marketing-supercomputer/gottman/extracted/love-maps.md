# Love Maps

## Core Principle
Love Maps are the cognitive room in your brain where you store all relevant information about your partner's life — their world, their worries, their joys, their dreams. Keeping this map updated is the foundation of the Sound Relationship House.

## How It Works
- Ask open-ended questions with paragraph-length answers (not yes/no)
- Examples: "What characteristic would you like to pass down from your family to our child?" / "What would be your ideal way of celebrating [holiday]?"
- The goal: Know your partner's values, priorities, needs, feelings — and keep updating because they CHANGE over time

## The Card Deck
- Gottman created a card deck (available on app) with questions for building Love Maps
- 100 questions for men's erotic world, 100 for women's — they're NOT the same questions
- Weekly practice: Sit down, go through cards, share openly

## Quote
"You need to keep asking your partner open-ended questions to know who they are... because those change over time as you're together."
