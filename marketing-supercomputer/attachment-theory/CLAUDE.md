# Attachment Theory — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Dr. Amir Levine, Dr. Stan Tatkin, and other attachment researchers'** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Attachment Theory's Domain
Attachment theory, as applied to adult romantic relationships by researchers like **Dr. Amir Levine** (*Attached*) and **Dr. Stan Tatkin** (*Wired for Love*), reveals that your behavior in relationships is largely driven by an **attachment style** formed in childhood: **Secure** (comfortable with intimacy and independence), **Anxious/Preoccupied** (craves closeness, hypervigilant to signs of rejection, prone to protest behaviors like excessive texting or jealousy), **Avoidant/Dismissive** (values independence above all, uses deactivating strategies like "I need space" or finding fault to maintain emotional distance), and **Disorganized/Fearful-Avoidant** (wants closeness but is terrified of it, oscillates between anxious and avoidant patterns). The most common and destructive pairing is the **anxious-avoidant trap**: the anxious partner's escalating bids for connection trigger the avoidant partner's withdrawal, which triggers more anxiety, creating a self-reinforcing death spiral that both partners mistake for incompatibility when it's actually their attachment systems colliding. Levine's work emphasizes identifying your style and choosing partners wisely, while Tatkin's **PACT (Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy)** focuses on how couples can become each other's **secure base** through co-regulation — using physical proximity, eye contact, voice tone, and ritualized connection to calm each other's nervous systems. The transformative insight: attachment style is not a life sentence — through awareness, intentional practice, and a willing partner, anyone can **earn secure attachment**.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using the researcher's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Dr. Levine found that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner

## Business Context
- **Free tier:** 2 assessments (Attachment + Love Language) + mood tracking
