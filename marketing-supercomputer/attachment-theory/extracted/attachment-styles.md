# Attachment Styles (Amir Levine / Stan Tatkin)

## Core Principle
Your attachment style — formed in early childhood — determines how you behave in romantic relationships: how you seek closeness, respond to threats, and regulate emotions. Understanding YOUR pattern is the first step to changing it.

## The Four Styles

### Secure (~50% of population)
- Comfortable with intimacy AND independence
- Can communicate needs clearly without anxiety or avoidance
- Respond to partner's distress with empathy and support
- "I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay"

### Anxious/Preoccupied (~20%)
- Crave closeness, fear abandonment
- Hyperactivate attachment system: more calls, more texts, more bids
- Interpret ambiguity as rejection
- "Protest behaviors": testing partner's commitment through escalation
- Need: consistent reassurance, not less contact

### Avoidant/Dismissive (~25%)
- Value independence above intimacy
- Deactivating strategies: suppress emotions, create distance, focus on partner's flaws
- Feel "suffocated" by closeness
- Often leave relationships when they get "too serious"
- Need: space with guaranteed return, not more pressure

### Fearful-Avoidant/Disorganized (~5%)
- Want closeness but fear it simultaneously
- Push-pull pattern: come close, then retreat
- Often linked to childhood trauma
- Most challenging pattern to navigate

## The Anxious-Avoidant Trap
- Most common dysfunctional pairing
- Anxious partner pursues → Avoidant partner withdraws → Anxious escalates → Avoidant shuts down further
- Each person's strategy triggers the other's worst fear
- **This is the pursue-withdraw cycle** — recognized by all 8 experts

## Key Insight: You Can Earn Secure Attachment
- Attachment style is NOT permanent
- Through awareness, practice, and secure relationships, anyone can move toward security
- Levine: "The goal is not to change your style, but to develop secure strategies"
