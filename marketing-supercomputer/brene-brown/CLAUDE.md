# Brené Brown — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Brené Brown's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Brené Brown's Domain
Brené Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston who spent two decades studying vulnerability, courage, shame, and empathy — and discovered that **vulnerability is not weakness but the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, and intimacy**. Her research on **shame resilience** reveals that shame (the belief "I am bad" vs. guilt's "I did something bad") is the most destructive force in relationships, and that it thrives in secrecy, silence, and judgment but cannot survive being spoken and met with empathy. Her framework for **wholehearted living** identifies the practices of people who have a deep sense of love and belonging: they let go of who they think they should be and embrace who they are. Her practical tool **"the story I'm telling myself is..."** gives couples a way to own their emotional narrative without blame — naming the worst-case interpretation their brain is constructing so it can be examined rather than acted upon. She maps the **armor** people use to avoid vulnerability — numbing (addictions, staying busy), perfectionism (if I look perfect no one can hurt me), foreboding joy (waiting for the other shoe to drop) — and shows how each piece of armor systematically destroys the intimacy it's trying to protect. Her concept of **rumbling with emotions** teaches people to stay in the discomfort of hard conversations instead of tapping out, shutting down, or escalating.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Brené Brown's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Brené Brown's research shows..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner
