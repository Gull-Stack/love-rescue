# The Six Human Needs (Tony Robbins)

## Core Principle
Every human behavior is driven by six core needs. Every relationship conflict traces back to unmet needs. Understanding which needs dominate YOUR behavior — and your partner's — lets you predict and prevent fights before they happen.

## The Six Needs

### 1. Certainty (Safety/Comfort)
- Need for stability, security, predictability
- In relationships: need to know the relationship is stable, partner is committed
- Shadow side: controlling behavior, rigidity, resistance to change
- Conflict trigger: surprises, spontaneity, unpredictability

### 2. Variety (Uncertainty/Adventure)
- Need for novelty, change, excitement
- In relationships: need for spontaneity, new experiences, passion
- Shadow side: recklessness, inability to commit, boredom-driven drama
- Conflict trigger: routine, predictability, feeling "stuck"

### 3. Significance (Importance)
- Need to feel unique, important, needed, special
- In relationships: need to feel valued, chosen, irreplaceable
- Shadow side: competition with partner, jealousy, putting others down to feel important
- Conflict trigger: feeling overlooked, partner prioritizing others

### 4. Connection/Love
- Need for closeness, warmth, belonging
- In relationships: need for emotional intimacy, physical closeness, being understood
- Shadow side: losing identity in relationship, people-pleasing, codependency
- Conflict trigger: emotional distance, partner withdrawing

### 5. Growth
- Need to evolve, learn, progress
- In relationships: need to grow together, develop as individuals
- Shadow side: never being satisfied, always wanting "more"
- Conflict trigger: stagnation, feeling like the relationship isn't going anywhere

### 6. Contribution
- Need to give beyond yourself, serve, make a difference
- In relationships: need to feel like you're adding value to your partner's life
- Shadow side: martyrdom, giving to get, burnout
- Conflict trigger: feeling unappreciated for what you give

## The Key Framework
- **Needs 1-4:** Needs of the personality (everyone finds a way to meet these)
- **Needs 5-6:** Needs of the spirit (fulfillment requires these)
- Your top 2 needs drive 80% of your decisions
- **Conflicts happen when partners' top needs clash:** Certainty person + Variety person = constant friction

## Vehicles: Healthy vs. Unhealthy
- Every need can be met through healthy OR unhealthy vehicles
- Significance through achievement (healthy) vs. through tearing partner down (unhealthy)
- Connection through vulnerability (healthy) vs. through codependency (unhealthy)
- The need isn't the problem — the VEHICLE is

## LoveRescue Application
- **Assessment (MISSING — HIGH PRIORITY):** Six Human Needs Assessment
  - Rank your 6 needs
  - Identify current vehicles (healthy vs. unhealthy)
  - Which needs you seek from relationship vs. elsewhere
- **In-App Insight:** "Robbins found that every fight traces to an unmet need. Your partner isn't being difficult — they're trying to meet a need you haven't recognized yet."
- **Cross-Assessment:** Significance + Avoidant attachment = needs to feel important but can't ask for it. Certainty + Anxious attachment = constant need for reassurance that relationship is safe.
- **Social Post:** "Your partner isn't being 'needy.' They have a need you haven't seen yet. Robbins identified 6 of them. Which one drives YOUR behavior? → loverescue.app"
