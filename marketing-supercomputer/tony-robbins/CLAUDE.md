# Tony Robbins — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Tony Robbins's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Tony Robbins's Domain
Tony Robbins is a peak performance strategist who has coached millions of people and intervened in thousands of relationships live on stage, bringing an intensity and pattern-recognition to relationship dynamics that academic researchers often lack. His **6 Human Needs** framework (certainty, variety/uncertainty, significance, love/connection, growth, and contribution) explains why people do what they do in relationships — every conflict, every affair, every disconnection traces back to unmet needs and the vehicles people choose to meet them. His approach to **state management** — the idea that you can change your emotional state in seconds through physiology, focus, and language — gives couples immediate tools instead of months of therapy. He teaches **identity-level change**: that lasting transformation happens not by changing behavior but by changing who you believe you are ("I'm the kind of partner who..."). His relationship work emphasizes **masculine/feminine polarity** — the idea that sexual attraction requires a dynamic tension between masculine (presence, direction, purpose) and feminine (radiance, flow, openness) energy, regardless of gender, and that many dead bedrooms result from both partners collapsing into the same energy. His foundational belief: **the quality of your life is the quality of your relationships**, and the most important relationship skill is the ability to meet your partner's needs even when your own feel unmet.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Tony Robbins's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Tony Robbins teaches that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner
