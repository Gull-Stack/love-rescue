## How To Use
1. **Daily Insights:** Pull a framework from any expert → write a 3-line insight for the app
2. **Ad Copy:** Reference specific stats/quotes from transcripts → build authority hooks
3. **Social Posts:** Extract top quotes → pair with LoveRescue CTA
4. **Strategy Content:** Map expert frameworks to weekly strategy assignments
5. **AI Advisor:** Each expert's extracted principles become a callable advisor persona

## Workflow
1. Transcripts land in `scripts/`
2. Claude extracts key frameworks, quotes, and principles → `extracted/`
3. Content generation pulls from `extracted/` → `output/`
4. Best output gets posted or fed into the app

## Core Philosophy (applies to ALL content)
- Mirror, not window — work on YOURSELF
- Reject victimhood — abundance creatorship
- Deprogramming through saturation — same truth from 10+ angles
- Each person works on themselves ONLY
- No weaponizing therapy
