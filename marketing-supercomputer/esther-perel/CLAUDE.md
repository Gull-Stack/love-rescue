# Esther Perel — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Esther Perel's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Esther Perel's Domain
Esther Perel is a Belgian psychotherapist and bestselling author who reframed the modern conversation about love by exposing the **impossible contradiction** at its center: we ask one person to give us what an entire village once provided — stability AND adventure, safety AND passion, a best friend AND an erotic lover. Her concept of **erotic intelligence** argues that desire needs mystery, space, and otherness to thrive — the very things that intimacy and closeness tend to eliminate. She is the leading voice on **navigating infidelity**, arguing that affairs are not simply about sex but about a longing for aliveness, lost parts of the self, and unlived lives — and that a relationship can sometimes emerge stronger after betrayal if both partners are willing to build a entirely new relationship together. Through her podcast *Where Should We Begin?* and books *Mating in Captivity* and *The State of Affairs*, Perel brings a **cultural lens** to love — showing how our expectations of marriage are historically unprecedented, culturally specific, and often suffocating. Her core provocation: the death of desire in long-term relationships is not a failure of the relationship but a predictable consequence of how we've structured it.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Esther Perel's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Esther Perel argues that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner
