# The Five Love Languages (Gary Chapman)

## Core Principle
Every person has a primary love language — the way they most deeply feel loved. Relationships break down when partners speak different languages. The key insight: give love in YOUR PARTNER'S language, not yours.

## The Five Languages

### 1. Words of Affirmation
- Verbal compliments, "I love you," encouragement, appreciation
- For these people: criticism is devastating, silence is deafening
- What to do: specific praise, not generic. "I love how you handled that meeting" > "You're great"

### 2. Quality Time
- Undivided attention, being fully present
- For these people: distraction = rejection (phone during dinner is a betrayal)
- What to do: scheduled date nights, devices away, eye contact, active listening

### 3. Receiving Gifts
- Tangible symbols of love and thoughtfulness
- NOT materialism — it's about the thought and effort
- For these people: forgotten birthdays/anniversaries are devastating
- What to do: small, thoughtful gifts that show "I was thinking about you"

### 4. Acts of Service
- Actions that make your partner's life easier
- "Let me do the dishes" / "I'll pick up the kids"
- For these people: laziness or broken promises feel like rejection
- What to do: ask "What can I do to help you today?"

### 5. Physical Touch
- Holding hands, hugs, cuddling, sexual intimacy, a hand on the shoulder
- For these people: physical neglect is emotional neglect
- What to do: intentional, non-sexual touch throughout the day

## Critical Insight: The Mirror Problem
- We naturally give love in OUR language, not our partner's
- A Words person showers their Acts partner with compliments → partner feels unloved
- Both are trying, both feel unappreciated → resentment builds
- Solution: learn their language and SPEAK IT, even if it's not natural for you

## Primary vs. Secondary
- Everyone has a primary and secondary language
- The primary is the must-have; the secondary is a nice-to-have
- Under stress, the primary language becomes even more dominant

## LoveRescue Application
- **Assessment (EXISTS):** Love Languages Quiz — Week 3 curriculum
- **Daily Practice:** One intentional act in your PARTNER'S love language per day
- **In-App Insight:** "Chapman's research shows that the #1 reason couples feel unloved isn't a lack of effort — it's a language mismatch. You're shouting 'I love you' in French. They only speak Japanese."
- **Cross-Assessment Connection:** Avoidant attachment + Acts of Service = shows love through DOING to avoid emotional vulnerability. Anxious + Words of Affirmation = constantly seeking verbal reassurance.
- **Social Post:** "You're not unloving. You're speaking the wrong language. Take the quiz. → loverescue.app"
