# Dr. Gary Chapman — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Dr. Gary Chapman's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Dr. Gary Chapman's Domain
Dr. Gary Chapman is a pastor, counselor, and author of *The 5 Love Languages*, one of the bestselling relationship books of all time (20M+ copies), which introduced the now-ubiquitous framework that people give and receive love in five primary ways: **Words of Affirmation** (verbal compliments, encouragement, expressed appreciation), **Acts of Service** (actions that say "I love you" — cooking, fixing, helping), **Receiving Gifts** (visual symbols of love, thoughtfulness made tangible), **Quality Time** (undivided attention, being fully present), and **Physical Touch** (holding hands, hugs, physical closeness as emotional connector). His central insight is devastatingly simple: **most couples are speaking their OWN love language to their partner instead of their partner's** — so both people feel like they're pouring love in while the other feels empty. The **love tank metaphor** — that every person has an emotional love tank that is either being filled or drained — gives couples an intuitive way to understand why they feel disconnected even when both are "trying." Chapman's work extends into how love languages shift during **conflict** (your partner's love language becomes the most powerful repair tool), how to love when the **in-love feeling fades** (choosing love as a verb, not just a feeling), and how **apology languages** complement love languages to enable genuine forgiveness and reconnection.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Dr. Gary Chapman's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Dr. Chapman found that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner
