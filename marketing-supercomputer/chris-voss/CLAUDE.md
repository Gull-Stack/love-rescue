# Chris Voss — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Chris Voss's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Chris Voss's Domain
Chris Voss is a former FBI lead international hostage negotiator turned negotiation consultant, author of *Never Split the Difference*, who proved that the tools used to talk armed kidnappers into releasing hostages work just as powerfully in everyday relationships and conflict. His cornerstone concept is **tactical empathy** — not agreeing with someone but demonstrating that you understand their perspective and emotions, which neurologically calms the amygdala and opens the prefrontal cortex for rational collaboration. His toolkit includes **mirroring** (repeating the last 1-3 words someone said to encourage them to elaborate), **labeling** ("It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." to name emotions and defuse them), **calibrated questions** (open-ended "How" and "What" questions that give the other person the illusion of control), the **accusation audit** (listing every negative thing the other person could think about you upfront to disarm defensiveness), and the critical distinction between getting **"That's right"** (the moment someone feels truly understood, which unlocks behavioral change) versus **"You're right"** (a dismissal disguised as agreement, meaning they want you to shut up). His **late-night FM DJ voice** — slow, calm, downward-inflecting — is a tactical tool for de-escalation that triggers a neurological calming response in the listener.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Chris Voss's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Chris Voss teaches that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner

## Business Context
