# Emotionally Focused Therapy — Hold Me Tight (Sue Johnson)

## Core Principle
Adult romantic love is an attachment bond — not just a feeling, but a survival mechanism. When that bond feels threatened, partners go into "protest behaviors" (pursue or withdraw). The key to healing is not conflict resolution — it's creating emotional SAFETY so partners can be vulnerable with each other.

## The Core Question
Every relationship conflict is really asking one question: **"Are you there for me?"**
- "Can I count on you?"
- "Do I matter to you?"
- "Will you respond when I need you?"
- When partners trust the answer is YES, everything else becomes manageable

## The Pursue-Withdraw Cycle (The Demon Dialogue)
- **The Pursuer:** Criticizes, demands, escalates — trying to get a response, ANY response. Underneath: "I'm terrified you don't care."
- **The Withdrawer:** Shuts down, goes silent, leaves the room. Underneath: "I can't do anything right. I'll just make it worse."
- Both are TRYING to protect the relationship in the only way they know how
- The cycle is the enemy — not your partner

## The Three Demon Dialogues
1. **Find the Bad Guy:** Both partners blame each other. "You started it!" / "No, YOU started it!"
2. **The Protest Polka:** One pursues, one withdraws. The more one pushes, the more the other retreats.
3. **Freeze and Flee:** Both withdraw. The relationship goes cold. Both give up trying.

## Hold Me Tight Conversations
Seven structured conversations that move couples from distress to secure bonding:
1. Recognizing the Demon Dialogues
2. Finding the Raw Spots (attachment injuries)
3. Revisiting a Rocky Moment
4. Hold Me Tight (the core: expressing deep attachment needs)
5. Forgiving Injuries
6. Bonding Through Sex and Touch
7. Keeping Your Love Alive

## The Softened Startup
- When the pursuer can stop criticizing and say "I'm scared you don't love me anymore" — everything shifts
- When the withdrawer can stop shutting down and say "I retreat because I'm afraid I'll lose you" — breakthrough
- The presenting emotion (anger, criticism) is NEVER the real one — underneath is fear, sadness, loneliness

## Key Concept: Attachment Injuries
- Specific incidents where one partner failed to show up when critically needed
- "I called you from the hospital and you didn't come"
- These become frozen moments that poison the relationship until explicitly addressed
- Healing requires: the injured partner expressing the pain, the other partner acknowledging it and offering comfort

- **Social Post:** "The pursuer isn't 'nagging.' The withdrawer isn't 'cold.' Both are terrified of losing each other. Johnson's EFT research proves the cycle is the enemy — not your partner. → loverescue.app"
