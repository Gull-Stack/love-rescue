# "Are You There for Me?" — The Core Question of Love (Sue Johnson)

## Core Principle
Adult romantic love is an attachment bond — a biological survival mechanism, not just a feeling. Every relationship conflict, at its root, is asking one question: "Are you there for me? Can I count on you? Do I matter to you?" When partners trust the answer is YES, everything else becomes manageable.

## A.R.E. — The Three Pillars of Secure Bonding
- **Accessible:** Can I reach you? Will you be available when I need you?
- **Responsive:** Can I count on you to respond to my emotional needs?
- **Engaged:** Will you value me and stay close?

## The Pursue-Withdraw Cycle (Demon Dialogues)
### Three Patterns:
1. **Find the Bad Guy:** Both attack. "You started it!" / "No, YOU did!" — mutual blame
2. **The Protest Polka:** One pursues (criticizes, demands) while the other withdraws (shuts down, leaves). The more one pushes, the more the other retreats. This is the most common and destructive pattern.
3. **Freeze and Flee:** Both withdraw. Cold silence. Both have given up trying. The relationship dies slowly.

### Underneath the Pattern:
- **The Pursuer's real message:** "I'm terrified you don't care. I'm reaching for you the only way I know how. My anger is my panic."
- **The Withdrawer's real message:** "I'm terrified I'll make it worse. I can't do anything right. I shut down because I don't know how to reach you without failing."
- BOTH are trying to protect the relationship. BOTH are scared. The CYCLE is the enemy, not the partner.

## Attachment Injuries
- Specific critical moments when one partner failed to show up for the other
- "I called you from the hospital and you didn't come"
- "When my mother died, you weren't there"
- These become frozen moments that poison everything until explicitly addressed
- **Healing requires:** The injured partner expressing the pain fully → the other partner acknowledging the impact and offering comfort → creating a new corrective experience

## Hold Me Tight Conversations (7 Steps)
1. **Recognize the Demon Dialogues** — name the cycle
2. **Find the Raw Spots** — attachment injuries and triggers
3. **Revisit a Rocky Moment** — slow it down, see each person's real feelings
4. **Hold Me Tight** — express deep attachment needs (the core conversation)
5. **Forgive Injuries** — process old wounds
6. **Bond Through Sex and Touch** — physical connection as emotional bonding
7. **Keep Your Love Alive** — maintenance rituals

## The Softened Startup
- When the pursuer can stop criticizing and say: "I push you because I'm scared of losing you"
- When the withdrawer can stop shutting down and say: "I go silent because I'm afraid I'll lose you if I say the wrong thing"
- This is the breakthrough moment — raw vulnerability breaks the cycle
