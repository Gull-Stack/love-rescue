# Dr. Sue Johnson — Knowledge Extraction Brief

I am Josh, co-founder of GullStack (Augment Advertise). We built **LoveRescue** (loverescue.app) — a relationship assessment and daily tracking app that helps couples strengthen their relationship by working on THEMSELVES, not each other.

We sell premium subscriptions ($9.99/mo) to couples who want science-backed self-improvement tools: 12 assessments, daily tracking, matchup scores, and personalized weekly strategies.

This folder contains transcripts from **Dr. Sue Johnson's** videos, podcasts, interviews, and guest appearances.

## Dr. Sue Johnson's Domain
Dr. Sue Johnson is the creator of **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**, the most empirically validated couples therapy in the world, with recovery rates of 70-75% and improvement rates of 90%. Her core insight is that adult romantic love is an **attachment bond** — not a bargain, not a negotiation, but a primal need for emotional connection as powerful as a child's need for a parent. Her **"Hold Me Tight"** framework identifies seven key conversations couples must have, built around three fundamental attachment questions: "Are you there for me? Can I reach you? Will you respond when I need you?" Johnson maps the destructive **pursue-withdraw cycle** (called "Demon Dialogues") where one partner escalates to get a response while the other shuts down to manage overwhelm, and both feel desperately alone. Her therapeutic breakthrough is helping couples access the **primary emotions** (fear, sadness, longing for connection) hiding beneath the **reactive secondary emotions** (anger, criticism, numbness) — and then use those vulnerable emotions to create new bonding interactions that restructure the attachment bond itself.

## Your Job: EXTRACT, Don't Summarize

For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:

1. **Name it** using Dr. Sue Johnson's own terminology
2. **State the core principle** in one sentence
3. **Include a direct quote** from the transcript
4. **Explain the underlying psychology** of why it works
5. **Show me specifically how to apply this to LoveRescue** — as an in-app insight, assessment question, daily strategy task, social media post, or ad hook

## Output Format
Save extracted frameworks to `extracted/` as individual markdown files:
`extracted/[framework-name-slugified].md`

## Content Generation Rules
When generating content FROM these frameworks:
- **Mirror, not window** — every piece of content points the reader back at themselves
- **Reject victimhood** — abundance creatorship, personal responsibility
- **Specific > generic** — "Pause 6 seconds before responding" beats "Communicate better"
- **Expert authority** — always attribute: "Dr. Sue Johnson found that..." or "Research shows..."
- **CTA to app** — every social post ends with a path to loverescue.app
- **No weaponizing** — these tools are for self-improvement, never ammunition against a partner
