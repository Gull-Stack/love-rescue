## THE SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00 – 0:12)

[Direct eye contact. Slight lean forward. Serious but warm.]

"Here's something nobody tells you about relationships. Love isn't enough."

[Beat. Let that land.]

"Loving your partner has never been the problem. The problem is that nobody gave you a strategy."

---

### THE PROBLEM (0:12 – 0:50)

[Slight head tilt. Empathetic expression. Measured pace.]

"Most couples don't fail because they stopped caring. They fail because they're running on autopilot — repeating the same patterns their parents had, reacting instead of choosing, and hoping that somehow… things will just get better."

[Gentle shake of head.]

"They won't. Not without a plan."

[Shift to more direct, confident tone.]

"Research from the Gottman Institute shows that the average couple waits *six years* after problems start before seeking help. Six years of the same arguments. The same walls going up. The same disconnect growing wider."

[Warm, inviting.]

"What if you didn't have to wait?"

---

### THE SOLUTION (0:50 – 1:38)

[Energy lifts. Open hand gestures. Genuine enthusiasm.]

"Love Rescue is a step-by-step system built on the work of over ten of the world's leading relationship scientists — from Dr. John Gottman's research on what actually predicts divorce, to attachment theory, to the science of emotional connection."

[Count on fingers, natural pacing.]

"Here's how it works."

"First, you take a series of personal assessments. Not couple's homework — *your own*. Your attachment style. Your love language. Your conflict patterns. Your emotional intelligence. Ten research-backed assessments that show you *your* patterns — the ones you can't see because you're inside them."

[Visual: app assessment screen]

"Then the app builds you a personalized strategy. Not generic advice — specific actions based on *your* results. What to practice. What to watch for. What to change."

[Visual: daily tracking screen]

"And every day, you track. Your mood. Your interactions. Your growth. Small data points that add up to massive transformation — the same way a fitness tracker changes how you exercise."

[Visual: matchup/progress screen]

"Over time, you start seeing your scores improve. Not because your partner changed — because *you* did."

---

### WHY STRATEGY MATTERS (1:38 – 2:02)

[Lean in slightly. This is the core message. Slower pace, more weight.]

"Here's what makes this different. Every expert in our system is saying the same thing from a different angle."

[Confident, almost conspiratorial.]

"Gottman says it through behavior science. Attachment theory says it through your childhood patterns. Tony Robbins says it through human needs. Chris Voss says it through the art of listening. Ten different voices, one truth:"

[Direct to camera. The line.]

"You are the only person you can change. And that's not a limitation — that's your superpower."

[Slight smile.]

"When you stop waiting for your partner to fix things and start working on yourself — *that's* when everything shifts."

---

### CTA (2:02 – 2:15)

[Warm smile. Encouraging. Open posture.]

"Your first assessment takes about five minutes. No credit card. No couple's assignment. Just you, learning about you."

[Nod.]

"Start your free assessment today. Because the best relationships aren't built on luck — they're built on strategy."

[Hold eye contact. Gentle smile. Fade.]

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

### Avatar Selection
- Male, 40s-50s, warm face, slight stubble acceptable
- Professional but approachable — polo or button-up, NO white coat (too clinical)
- Think: "the therapist your friend recommended who actually changed their life"

### Voice
- Warm baritone, American English
- NOT announcer-voice. NOT clinical monotone.
- Conversational speed: ~145 words/minute (this script is ~340 words)
- If using ElevenLabs: moderate stability (0.5), high clarity (0.8), slight expressiveness

### Pacing & Expression
- **0:00–0:12 (Hook):** Serious, direct. Like sharing an important truth one-on-one.
- **0:12–0:50 (Problem):** Empathetic, understanding. "I've seen this before" energy.
- **0:50–1:38 (Solution):** Energy lifts 20%. Genuine excitement about the system. Natural hand gestures.
- **1:38–2:02 (Why):** Slow down. This is the core philosophy. Every word should have weight.
- **2:02–2:15 (CTA):** Warm, encouraging, like a friend saying "you should really try this."

### Key Moments to Nail
- "Love isn't enough" — needs to land with weight, not sound like a tagline
- "Six years" — slight pause before and after the number
- "You are the only person you can change" — THE thesis. Slow. Direct. Eye contact.
- "That's your superpower" — small smile, slight upward inflection. Hope.

### What to AVOID
- ❌ Sounding like an infomercial
- ❌ Rushing through the expert names (let them breathe)
- ❌ Being preachy or condescending
- ❌ Generic "life coaching" energy
- ❌ Dramatic music swells (keep soundtrack subtle and warm)

### Music
- Ambient, warm piano or soft acoustic guitar
- Fades in at 0:05, stays low under dialogue
- Slight lift during the solution section (0:50–1:38)
- Drops to near-silence for the "superpower" line
- Gentle resolution under CTA
