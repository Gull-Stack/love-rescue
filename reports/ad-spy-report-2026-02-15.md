## APP IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Improvement 10: "No Judgment" AI Positioning (NEW)
CoupleWork AI has proven that framing AI as "neutral, no judgment, no sides" resonates powerfully. LoveRescue should:
- Add copy to onboarding: "Your AI guide never takes sides. It focuses on solutions, not blame."
- Marketing angle: "The only couples app that doesn't pick favorites."

### Improvement 11: Male-Specific Onboarding Flow (NEW)
Relatio is crushing it with male-focused ads. LoveRescue opportunity:
- Create male-specific assessment questions
- Marketing: "Finally, relationship help that gets where you're coming from"
- Positioning: Frame assessments as "practical tools" not "emotional work"

## QUIZ FUNNEL DEEP DIVE (RELATIO)

**Relatio's Funnel:**
1. Long-form Facebook ad (3,000+ word story)
2. CTA: "Learn more" → quiz.getrelatio.com
3. Quiz asks about breakup situation
4. Personalized results page
5. App download with pre-filled context

**Why It Works:**
- Hyper-specific targeting (men who want ex back)
- Quiz creates investment before download
- Personalization makes app feel "built for you"
- Email capture for retargeting non-converters

**LoveRescue Counter-Strategy:**
We have 10+ assessments. Relatio has 1 quiz. We need:
1. Web-based quiz at loverescue.app/quiz (Attachment Style, 5-7 questions)
2. Problem-specific landing pages (communication, intimacy, conflict)
3. Retargeting ads: "Your relationship score is waiting"
