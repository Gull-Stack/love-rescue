## Ad Format & Creative Trends (Feb 2026)

### 🎥 Dominant Format: Reels/Short-Form Video
- **55%+ of all Instagram ads now run on Reels** (up from 35% in 2024) — CNBC/Sensor Tower data
- TikTok + Reels = mandatory placement for relationship apps
- Paired is ALL-IN on TikTok (57K followers, almost 1M likes)

### 📱 What's Working in App UA Creatives (2026)

**UGC-Style Performance Creative (NOT old-school testimonials)**
- Old ring-light testimonials are DEAD — CPT skyrocketing, trial-to-paid falling
- Tutorials & app reviews generate **45% higher IPM** and **17% better D7 retention** vs testimonials (AppsFlyer 2025 report)
- Winning formula: **value-first content that entertains/teaches, selling second**

**Top Hook Formats:**
1. **Skit-style** — relatable couple scenarios (TikTok/Reels dominant)
2. **Problem-agitate-solve** — "My relationship was falling apart until..."
3. **Curiosity gaps** — "The one thing couples therapists won't tell you"
4. **Transformation stories** — before/after emotional states
5. **Interactive/quiz teasers** — "Take this 2-min quiz to find out..."

### 🪝 Hooks Observed Across Competitors

| Competitor | Hook Style | Example Angles |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Paired** | Gamified/fun | "Daily questions that actually make you laugh together" |
| **Lasting** | Clinical/trust | "Based on the #1 marriage research" (Gottman) |
| **Flamme** | Wellness framing | "Falling in love is easy. Staying in love needs work." |
| **Coral** | Vulnerability/intimacy | "The conversation you've been avoiding" |
| **Relish** | Coach/authority | "Your personal relationship coach, 24/7" |

### 📣 CTAs That Convert (Industry-Wide)
1. **"Try free for 7 days"** — still #1 performing CTA for subscription apps
2. **"Take the quiz"** — high-intent, low-friction entry point
3. **"Download free"** — works for top-funnel awareness
4. **"See your relationship score"** — gamified conversion
5. **"Start your journey"** — aspiration-based

### 💡 Key Insight: The "Gym for Your Relationship" Framing
Flamme is explicitly using this: *"Relationship Wellness isn't just for couples with issues — just like gyms aren't only for those out of shape."*
- This destigmatizes the app (not just for "broken" relationships)
- Positions as proactive self-improvement, not reactive crisis management
- **LoveRescue should consider this framing** to broaden TAM

---

## Meta Ads Benchmarks (2026)
- **Average CTR:** 1.4%–1.7% across industries
- **Top-performing creative lifespan:** Shorter than ever — creative fatigue is accelerating
- **Andromeda algorithm:** Meta's new ad delivery system rewards novelty + authenticity
- **Recommendation:** Rotate creatives every 7-10 days minimum

## Strategic Takeaways for LoveRescue

### Opportunities
1. **LoveFix is new and positioning on "conflict repair"** — LoveRescue should differentiate or out-position them NOW before they scale
2. **AI Coach angle is underexploited** — only Flamme is doing this. LoveRescue's "therapist API" is a competitive moat
3. **Assessment-to-app pipeline** — SYMBIS proves church/facilitator network is viable distribution. LoveRescue has 10 assessment types — leverage for B2B2C
4. **Widget strategy** — MoodMe's home screen widget approach drives daily retention. Consider for LoveRescue
5. **Reels-first creative strategy** is non-negotiable for 2026 UA

### Threats
1. **Paired's TikTok dominance** — they own the fun/gamified positioning on the biggest growth channel
2. **"Fake UGC" fatigue** — scripted testimonials actively hurt conversion now. Must invest in authentic performance creative
3. **Creative fatigue acceleration** — need high creative velocity (3-5 new concepts/week minimum)
4. **LoveFix** entering the "rescue/repair" space directly
