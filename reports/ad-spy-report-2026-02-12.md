## Competitor Activity Scan

### 🔴 Paired (HIGH THREAT)
- **Status:** Active advertising on Meta + TikTok. Google Play listing updated Jan 2026.
- **Model:** Freemium (1 free question/day + Sunday quiz). Premium unlocks all content. If one partner pays, other gets access free.
- **Pricing:** Monthly or yearly subscription (not publicly listed, estimated ~$12-15/mo)
- **Ad Strategy:** Heavy UGC skit-style Reels. Daily question format drives organic shares. TikTok remains their #1 growth channel (~57K followers).
- **New:** Rebrand with fresh visual identity — "Paired Unveils Exciting Updates" press push. Leaning into "stay in love" vs "fix problems" positioning.
- **Takeaway:** They're playing offense while we play defense. Their "daily question" mechanic is brilliant for retention AND ad creative (each question = potential viral clip).

### 🔴 Lasting (HIGH THREAT)
- **Status:** Active Meta ads. Apple "App of the Day" featured.
- **Pricing:** $29.99/month — premium positioning.
- **Model:** Structured Gottman-method sessions. "94% report new relationship strengths" is their main proof point.
- **Ad Strategy:** Clinical credibility + transformation narratives. "Marriage counseling made simple" framing.
- **Takeaway:** At $30/mo they're the most expensive — proving couples will pay premium for credible, structured programs. LoveRescue has MORE assessments but charges less. Opportunity to position as "Lasting quality, but with 10x the tools."

### 🟡 Coral (MEDIUM → RISING)
- **Status:** Active. Rebranded from "Coral: Intimacy for Couples" to "Coral: Couples & Relationship" — expanding TAM.
- **Features:** Daily prompts, love languages, guided intimacy exercises, in-app messaging (encrypted).
- **Awards:** Apple App of the Day, Developer Spotlight, Valentine's Day Essentials, Apps Made by Women UK.
- **Ad Copy Angle:** "Make connection a daily habit" — focusing on micro-habits over big therapy commitments.
- **Takeaway:** Their expansion from intimacy→full relationship signals market demand for comprehensive apps. LoveRescue already IS comprehensive — we just need to communicate it better.

### 🟡 Flamme (MEDIUM)
- **Status:** Active on App Store. Heavy feature set expansion.
- **Features Now:** 1000+ quizzes, AI Relationship Coach, couples widgets, shared bucket list, long-distance tools.
- **Pricing:** Free + Premium tiers.
- **Ad Strategy:** "Relationship Wellness" framing. AI coach is their differentiator.
- **Takeaway:** Flamme is becoming feature-bloated (quizzes, widgets, bucket lists, AI). They're trying to be everything. LoveRescue should stay focused on DEPTH over breadth — our 8 expert frameworks + 10 assessments go deeper than their 1000 shallow quizzes.

### 🔴 LoveFix (HIGH — NEW ENTRANT)
- **Status:** Featured in Digg's "Best Relationship Apps 2026" roundup alongside Paired, Lasting, Coral, Relish.
- **Positioning:** "Conflict repair" — DIRECTLY overlaps with "LoveRescue" name/positioning.
- **Takeaway:** This is the closest naming/positioning threat. Monitor closely. Our advantage: we don't just fix — we build. Rescue → Thrive narrative.

### 🟡 Relish (MEDIUM)
- **Status:** Still active but lower marketing presence. Tracxn lists OurRitual and Felt as top competitors (not us — we're not on their radar yet).
- **Model:** Subscription + human coaching. Real coaches = trust but doesn't scale.
- **Takeaway:** Human coaching model creates price floor we can undercut with AI therapist.

### 🟢 OurRelationship (LOW)
- **Status:** Evidence-based, academic-backed. Featured in Digg roundup.
- **Model:** Likely insurance-subsidized or grant-funded.
- **Takeaway:** Different business model. Not a direct commercial threat.

### 🟢 SYMBIS (LOW — DIFFERENT MODEL)
- **Status:** B2B2C via church facilitators. Pre-marriage assessment focus.
- **Takeaway:** Their distribution model (church networks) remains worth studying for LoveRescue's faith-friendly positioning.

### 🟢 Evergreen / Moodie / CoupleWork AI / Relatio / ChatWren / Metamorphosis CCT
- **Status:** Minimal or no visible Meta ad activity. Low app store presence.
- **Takeaway:** Not currently competitive threats. Monitor quarterly.
