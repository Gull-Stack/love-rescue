## Day 1 (Monday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Carousel (5 slides) / TikTok text-on-screen
**Pillar:** 🔥 Hot Take
**Hook:** "Your relationship isn't failing. You just never learned how to do it right."
**Caption:**
Nobody taught you how to love well. Not your parents. Not school. Not the movies you grew up on.

You learned math, history, how to write an essay — but ZERO hours on the one thing that impacts your happiness more than anything else.

So when your relationship feels hard? That's not a sign it's broken. That's a sign you're untrained.

Slide 👉 for the 5 skills nobody taught you (but every couple needs).

1️⃣ Repair after conflict (not winning the fight)
2️⃣ Expressing needs without blame
3️⃣ Understanding your attachment triggers
4️⃣ Turning toward bids for connection
5️⃣ Daily micro-deposits of love

The good news? You can learn all of this. Starting today.

**Caption:**

## Day 1 (Monday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (talking head + text overlay, 30s)
**Pillar:** 💡 Quick Tip
**Hook:** "Stop saying 'we need to talk.' Say this instead."
**Caption:**
"We need to talk" activates your partner's nervous system before you even start.

Try: "Hey, I've been thinking about something and I'd love your perspective."

Same conversation. Completely different outcome. One feels like a threat. The other feels like an invitation.

Small shifts. Massive results.

## Day 2 (Tuesday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok (45s)
**Pillar:** 💬 Expert Wisdom
**Hook:** "John Gottman studied 3,000 couples. Here's the #1 predictor of divorce."
**Caption:**
It's not cheating. It's not money. It's not even bad communication.

It's contempt. 🫠

Rolling your eyes. Mocking. Name-calling. Sarcasm that cuts.

Gottman calls it the single greatest predictor of divorce — with 93% accuracy.

The antidote? Building a culture of appreciation. Daily. Intentionally.

LoveRescue's gratitude journal helps you do exactly that — 60 seconds a day to rewire how you see your partner.

## Day 2 (Tuesday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (greenscreen + text, 20s)
**Pillar:** 🔥 Hot Take
**Hook:** "If your partner doesn't know your attachment style, you're playing the game blindfolded."
**Caption:**
You wouldn't drive without knowing the rules of the road.

But most couples are navigating the most important relationship of their life with ZERO understanding of how they're wired.

Anxious. Avoidant. Secure. Disorganized.

Each one fights differently. Loves differently. Shuts down differently.

Know yours. Know theirs. Change everything.

## Day 3 (Wednesday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok (35s)
**Pillar:** 💡 Quick Tip
**Hook:** "The 6-second kiss that can save your marriage."
**Caption:**
Gottman's research says couples who kiss for 6 seconds or longer when they say goodbye create a moment of genuine connection.

Not the dry peck. Not the autopilot forehead tap.

Six real seconds.

It forces you to be present. It releases oxytocin. It says: "You matter to me more than my rush out the door."

Try it tomorrow morning. Watch what shifts.

Then log it in LoveRescue and start tracking the little things that actually move the needle. 📈

## Day 3 (Wednesday) - Post 2
**Platform:** Instagram
**Format:** Carousel (5 slides)
**Pillar:** 💬 Expert Wisdom
**Hook:** "Brené Brown says vulnerability is not weakness. Here's what that actually looks like in a relationship."
**Caption:**
Brené Brown changed how we think about vulnerability. But most couples still don't practice it.

Here's what vulnerability ACTUALLY looks like between partners 👇

Slide 1: "I'm scared you're going to leave" instead of picking a fight to test them
Slide 2: "I need reassurance" instead of going silent and waiting for them to notice
Slide 3: "That hurt me" instead of pretending you're fine
Slide 4: "I don't know how to fix this" instead of bulldozing with solutions

Vulnerability isn't weakness. It's the only path to real intimacy.

LoveRescue's 16-week course includes an entire module on vulnerability with insights from Brené Brown's research. Start free.

## Day 3 (Wednesday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (POV skit, 25s)
**Pillar:** 📊 Quiz Teaser
**Hook:** "POV: You just found out you're anxiously attached and everything about your love life finally makes sense."
**Caption:**
The way you blow up their phone when they don't text back.
The way you need constant reassurance.
The way you're always "too much."

You're not crazy. You're anxiously attached.

And once you know it? You can actually do something about it.

## Day 4 (Thursday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Carousel (6 slides) / TikTok slideshow
**Pillar:** ❤️ Transformation Story
**Hook:** "30 days of tracking our relationship changed everything. Here's the data."
**Caption:**
We started logging daily in LoveRescue — mood, connection, conflict, gratitude.

Here's what 30 days of data showed us:

📊 Week 1: 3 conflicts, 1 repair attempt, connection score 4/10
📊 Week 2: 2 conflicts, 3 repair attempts, connection score 6/10
📊 Week 3: 1 conflict, 2 repair attempts, connection score 7/10
📊 Week 4: 1 conflict, 4 repair attempts, connection score 9/10

What changed? We didn't go to therapy. We didn't read a book. We just started PAYING ATTENTION.

When you measure something, you improve it. Period.

## Day 4 (Thursday) - Post 2
**Platform:** Instagram
**Format:** Story (2-part)
**Pillar:** 🔥 Hot Take
**Hook:** "Unpopular opinion: Most couples don't need therapy. They need a system."
**Caption:**
Story 1: "Unpopular opinion: Most couples don't need therapy. They need a DAILY SYSTEM. Therapy is 1 hour a week. Your relationship is the other 167 hours. What's your plan for those?" (This/That sticker: "Therapy only" vs "Daily system")

## Day 4 (Thursday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (duet-style reaction, 30s)
**Pillar:** 💬 Expert Wisdom
**Hook:** "Chris Voss negotiated with terrorists. Here's his #1 tip for couples."
**Caption:**
Chris Voss (FBI lead hostage negotiator) says the most powerful phrase in any conversation is:

"It sounds like…"

"It sounds like you're frustrated."
"It sounds like you don't feel heard."
"It sounds like this really matters to you."

It's called labeling. And it de-escalates EVERYTHING.

Your partner isn't a hostage taker. But your nervous system doesn't know that during a fight. 😅

Learn Chris Voss's techniques (and 10 other experts) inside LoveRescue's 16-week course.

## Day 5 (Friday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok (40s)
**Pillar:** 💡 Quick Tip
**Hook:** "The 5:1 ratio that predicts whether your relationship will last."
**Caption:**
Gottman found that stable, happy couples have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

That means for every criticism, eye roll, or snappy comment — you need FIVE positive moments to balance it out.

A compliment. A laugh together. A touch. A "thank you." A real listen.

Most struggling couples? They're at 1:1. Or worse — 1:3.

You don't need to eliminate the negative. You need to FLOOD the positive.

Start tracking your ratio with LoveRescue's daily log. You can't fix what you can't see.

## Day 5 (Friday) - Post 2
**Platform:** Instagram
**Format:** Carousel (4 slides)
**Pillar:** 📊 Quiz Teaser
**Hook:** "The 4 attachment styles, explained in 60 seconds."
**Caption:**
Stop guessing. Start understanding. 👇

🔒 Secure: Comfortable with closeness AND independence. Communicates needs clearly. The gold standard.

😰 Anxious: Craves closeness, fears abandonment. Tends to over-give, over-text, over-worry.

🧊 Avoidant: Values independence, uncomfortable with too much closeness. Pulls away under pressure.

🌀 Disorganized: Wants intimacy but fears it. Push-pull pattern. Often from trauma.

80% of relationship conflict comes from attachment clashes.

The first step is knowing yours.

## Day 5 (Friday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (trending audio + text, 20s)
**Pillar:** 🔥 Hot Take
**Hook:** "Your relationship has a score. You just haven't been tracking it."
**Caption:**
You track your steps. Your calories. Your sleep. Your screen time.

But the ONE thing that affects your happiness more than all of those combined?

Your relationship.

Zero data. Zero tracking. Zero accountability.

Until now.

LoveRescue gives your relationship a matchup score, daily logs, and streak tracking — so you can actually see what's working.

## Day 6 (Saturday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok (35s)
**Pillar:** 💡 Quick Tip
**Hook:** "Replace 'you always' with this one phrase and watch your fights transform."
**Caption:**
"You always forget."
"You never listen."
"You always make it about you."

"Always" and "never" are relationship poison. They put your partner on trial.

Replace with: "The story I'm telling myself is…"

"The story I'm telling myself is that you don't care when you forget."

Same feeling. Zero attack. Maximum chance of being heard.

This is straight from Brené Brown's work — and it's inside LoveRescue's expert course.

## Day 6 (Saturday) - Post 2
**Platform:** Instagram
**Format:** Carousel (5 slides)
**Pillar:** ❤️ Transformation Story
**Hook:** "We almost broke up. Then we started a 16-week experiment."
**Caption:**
We were fighting every week. Disconnected. Running on autopilot.

We almost called it. Instead, we started LoveRescue's 16-week Love Mastery course together.

Week 2: Took the attachment quiz. I'm anxious. He's avoidant. 💡 Everything clicked.
Week 5: Started the gratitude journal. He wrote "I'm grateful you still try." I cried.
Week 9: Our first conflict where we BOTH repaired within an hour.
Week 16: We're not perfect. But we have a SYSTEM. And we actually like each other again.

This isn't magic. It's practice. With the right tools.

## Day 6 (Saturday) - Post 3
**Platform:** TikTok
**Format:** TikTok (storytime, 40s)
**Pillar:** 📱 App Feature
**Hook:** "We've been doing gratitude journaling as a couple for 30 days straight 🔥"
**Caption:**
Every night before bed, we each write one thing we're grateful for about each other in LoveRescue.

It takes 30 seconds. We have a 30-day streak.

And honestly? It's changed more than the 6 months of therapy we did before this.

Because it's daily. It's specific. And seeing what your partner writes about you hits DIFFERENT.

Day 1 he wrote: "Grateful you made dinner."
Day 14 he wrote: "Grateful you don't give up on us."
Day 30 he wrote: "Grateful I get to do life with you."

I'm not crying. You're crying. 😭

## Day 7 (Sunday) - Post 1
**Platform:** Both
**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok (30s)
**Pillar:** 🔥 Hot Take
**Hook:** "The reason your relationship feels boring isn't because of your partner."
**Caption:**
It's because you stopped being intentional.

You used to plan dates. Ask deep questions. Flirt. Try.

Now it's Netflix, phones, and "what do you want for dinner?"

Boredom isn't a relationship problem. It's a YOU problem.

And the fix isn't a new partner. It's a new system.

LoveRescue gives you daily prompts, weekly challenges, and expert-guided lessons to bring the spark back — without the cringe.
