## Section 1: The Problem

### Section Header
**You're Not Broken. You're Just Guessing.**

### Body Copy
Every couple fights. That's not the problem.

The problem is that you don't know *why* you fight the way you do. Why you shut down. Why they escalate. Why the same pattern plays out over and over — different topic, same wound.

It's not a communication problem. It's a **pattern recognition** problem.

And until you see the pattern, you can't change it.

### Supporting Stat
**67% of relationship problems are perpetual — they never get "solved." The couples who thrive aren't the ones with fewer problems. They're the ones who understand the patterns underneath.**
*— Dr. John Gottman, 40 years of research, 3,000+ couples studied*

## Section 2: Three Benefit Blocks

### Block Layout
Three columns (desktop) / stacked cards (mobile). Each with icon, headline, short copy.

---

### Benefit 1: Map Your Attachment Style
**Icon:** 🧬 (or custom DNA/brain illustration)

**Headline:** Discover Your Exact Attachment Style

**Copy:**
Anxious. Avoidant. Fearful-avoidant. Secure. Or — more likely — a nuanced mix that shifts based on who you're with and what's triggered.

The free attachment assessment maps your specific patterns: how you bond, how you fight, what you need but can't ask for, and why certain relationships feel impossible while others feel easy.

This isn't a BuzzFeed quiz. It's built on Dr. Amir Levine's attachment framework and validated against decades of clinical research.

**Micro-CTA:** *3 minutes. Free. Zero fluff.*

---

### Benefit 2: Get Personalized Strategies (Not Generic Advice)
**Icon:** 🎯 (or custom target/strategy illustration)

**Headline:** 121 Expert Techniques — Matched to YOU

**Copy:**
"Just communicate better" isn't a strategy. It's a bumper sticker.

LoveRescue pulls from 121 specific techniques developed by 11 of the world's leading relationship experts — Gottman, Sue Johnson, Brené Brown, Esther Perel, Chris Voss, Tony Robbins, Stan Tatkin, Gary Chapman, Amir Levine, Jordan Belfort, and Jennifer Finlayson-Fife.

Based on your assessment results, the app recommends the exact strategies that address YOUR patterns. Not random tips. Not AI-generated platitudes. Research-backed frameworks matched to your specific attachment style, conflict tendencies, and relationship dynamics.

**Micro-CTA:** *Your strategies are waiting inside your results.*

---

### Benefit 3: Track What Actually Changes
**Icon:** 📊 (or custom chart/trend illustration)

**Headline:** Daily Check-Ins That Take 5 Minutes

**Copy:**
Insight without action is just trivia. LoveRescue includes a daily check-in that tracks your mood, your closeness, and your patterns over time.

In 5 minutes a day, you'll start seeing:
- When you tend to drift apart (day of week, time of month, stress patterns)
- What brings you back together (which strategies actually work for YOU)
- How your dynamics interact with your partner's (if they join too)

After 2 weeks, you'll have more data about your relationship than most couples get in a year of therapy.

**Micro-CTA:** *Daily tracking is free. Completely free.*

## Section 3: The Expert Credibility Block

### Section Header
**Built on Research From the World's Best. Not a Random AI.**

## Section 4: Social Proof

### Section Header
**What People Are Discovering**

### Testimonial Cards
*(Note: Replace with real testimonials as they come in. These are placeholder structures.)*

> **"We could finally SEE the pattern."**
> "After two weeks of daily check-ins, my husband and I had a conversation we'd been avoiding for a year. The data made it safe. We could point to the graph and say 'look, this is where we drift' instead of blaming each other."
> — *Sarah, 34, married 6 years*

> **"Better than the $3,000 we spent on couples therapy."**
> "I'm not anti-therapy — we still go. But LoveRescue gave us a framework our therapist didn't. Knowing our attachment styles and seeing how they interact changed everything about how we fight."
> — *Marcus, 41, in a relationship 8 years*

> **"I thought I was just 'bad at relationships.' Turns out I'm fearful-avoidant."**
> "Taking the attachment assessment was like someone handing me the manual to my own brain. I literally cried reading my results because it was so accurate. Now I have actual tools, not just awareness."
> — *Jess, 29, single (working on it)*

## Section 6: FAQ

### Section Header
**Questions? Good. Here Are Answers.**

**Q: Is this actually free?**
A: Yes. Two full assessments (attachment style + love language), daily mood/closeness tracking, and the personalized strategy engine are 100% free. No credit card required. No trial that expires. Free means free.

**Q: Do both partners need to use it?**
A: Nope. LoveRescue works whether you use it solo or with your partner. The assessments and strategies are personalized to YOU. If your partner joins, you unlock matchup dynamics — but it's not required.

**Q: Is this a replacement for therapy?**
A: No — and we don't claim to be. LoveRescue is a tool built on the same science therapists use. Many users do both. Think of it as the data layer: you understand your patterns, and if you go to therapy, you walk in knowing exactly what to work on.

**Q: What makes this different from other relationship apps?**
A: Three things. (1) The science — 10 validated assessments, not quizzes. (2) The experts — 121 techniques from 11 researchers who've spent decades studying love, attachment, and human connection. (3) The personalization — everything is matched to YOUR specific results, not generic advice.

**Q: How long does the assessment take?**
A: About 3 minutes for the attachment assessment. Love language takes about 2 minutes. The full suite of 10 assessments (Premium) takes about 30 minutes total, but you can do them anytime.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Extremely. Your assessment results and tracking data are encrypted and never shared. We don't sell data. We don't show ads. Our business model is Premium subscriptions, not your personal information.

**Q: What if I'm single?**
A: LoveRescue works for singles too. Understanding your attachment style transforms how you date, who you're attracted to, and why past relationships followed certain patterns. Several of our assessments are designed for individuals, not just couples.
