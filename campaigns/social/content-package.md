What's your attachment style? 🧬

Most people walk around with NO idea why they react the way they do in relationships.

Anxious? You need constant reassurance and read into everything.
Avoidant? You pull away the second things get real.  
Fearful-Avoidant? You want love but you sabotage it every time.
Secure? You're the goal. But even secure people have triggers.

The wildest part? Your style CHANGES depending on who you're with.

## Content Piece 2: "Things Couples Therapists Wish You Knew" Carousel

**Format:** Instagram Carousel — 5 slides + cover
**Goal:** Saves, shares, authority building
**Design Style:** Clean, editorial, pink-to-red gradient accents, bold serif headlines, expert quotes in handwriting or italic font

### Slide-by-Slide Breakdown

#### Cover Slide (Slide 0)
- **Headline:** "5 Things Couples Therapists Wish You Knew"
- **Subtext:** "Before you spend $2,400 on sessions"
- **Design:** Bold headline, gradient background (#f093fb → #f5576c), minimal — let the text breathe
- **Visual:** No stock photos. Clean typography only. Maybe a subtle broken/mended heart icon.

#### Slide 1: "You're Not Fighting About What You Think You're Fighting About"
- **Body text:** "That argument about dishes? It's actually about feeling unseen. The money fight? It's about safety and control. Every surface-level conflict has an attachment need underneath it."
- **Expert quote:** *"Behind every criticism is a wish. Behind every withdrawal is a need."* — Dr. Sue Johnson, Creator of EFT
- **Design note:** White background, bold headline in dark text, quote in italicized pink/red accent text. Clean divider line.

#### Slide 2: "The 5:1 Ratio Is Non-Negotiable"
- **Body text:** "Gottman found that stable relationships have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. Not 1:1. Not 2:1. FIVE positive moments for every one negative. Most couples in distress? They're at 0.8:1."
- **Expert quote:** *"It's not about avoiding conflict. It's about what you do between the conflicts."* — Dr. John Gottman
- **Design note:** Big "5:1" as the visual anchor. Could be illustrated as a balance scale or simple ratio graphic.

#### Slide 3: "Vulnerability Is Not Weakness — It's the Entire Point"
- **Body text:** "The couples who last aren't the ones who never fight. They're the ones who can say 'I'm scared' instead of 'you're wrong.' Brené Brown's research shows that vulnerability is the birthplace of connection. Not comfort. Not safety. Vulnerability."
- **Expert quote:** *"We can't selectively numb emotions. When we numb the painful ones, we also numb joy, gratitude, and love."* — Brené Brown
- **Design note:** Slightly darker/moodier slide. Deep gradient background, white text. Feels different from the others — mirrors the discomfort of vulnerability.

#### Slide 4: "Your Partner Is Not Your Enemy — They're Your Mirror"
- **Body text:** "Chris Voss (FBI hostage negotiator turned relationship strategist) teaches that the same skills that de-escalate a hostage situation work in your kitchen at 11pm. Tactical empathy. Labeling emotions. Mirroring. Your partner isn't attacking you — they're trying to be heard."
- **Expert quote:** *"Negotiation is not an act of battle. It's a process of discovery."* — Chris Voss
- **Design note:** Slightly unexpected — the FBI angle creates pattern interrupt. Could include a subtle badge/shield icon.

#### Slide 5 (CTA Slide): "You Don't Need to Know All of This. You Need a System That Does."
- **Body text:** "LoveRescue combines research from Gottman, Johnson, Brown, Voss, and 7 more world-class experts into 10 assessments and 121 personalized techniques. Free to start."
- **CTA:** "Take the free assessment → link in bio"
- **Design note:** Gradient background, LoveRescue logo, clean CTA button graphic. Feels like the natural conclusion, not a hard sell.

## Content Piece 3: "The 5-Minute Rule That Saved Our Marriage" UGC-Style Video

**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok — 45-60 seconds
**Goal:** Relatability, saves, app downloads
**Style:** UGC (user-generated content) aesthetic — phone camera, natural lighting, real-feeling. NOT polished. Authenticity is the creative strategy.

### Script

**[Scene: Kitchen or living room. Natural light. Person talking directly to camera, phone propped up. Slightly messy background — real, not staged. They're mid-30s, relatable, not "influencer" energy.]**

**0:00-0:05**
*[Looking at camera, slightly vulnerable but not dramatic]*
"Okay so I never post stuff like this but I need to share something because it literally changed my marriage."

**0:05-0:12**
*[Slight head shake, genuine]*
"We were in that place where — you know when you're not fighting but you're also not... anything? Just coexisting? Like roommates who share a bed?"

**TEXT OVERLAY: "the roommate phase 💀"**

**0:12-0:20**
*[Leaning in slightly]*
"A friend sent me this app called LoveRescue. I thought it was gonna be some couples therapy homework thing. But it's literally just a 5-minute check-in. Every morning."

**TEXT OVERLAY: "5 minutes. that's it."**

**0:20-0:30**
*[Gets slightly animated]*
"You rate your mood, how connected you feel, and it gives you ONE thing to try that day. And it's not like 'go on a date night' — it's actual science stuff. Gottman techniques, attachment exercises. My husband started doing it too and we started seeing our PATTERNS."

**TEXT OVERLAY: "we could literally SEE when we were drifting"**

**0:30-0:40**
*[More emotional, but restrained — not performative]*
"After two weeks we had this conversation that we'd been avoiding for like... a year? And it wasn't scary because we both already knew what the data was showing. We weren't guessing anymore."

**TEXT OVERLAY: "the data made the hard conversation easier"**

**STAT CALLOUT (appears on screen): "Gottman research: couples who check in daily are 31% more likely to report relationship satisfaction — Journal of Marriage and Family"**

**0:40-0:50**
*[Back to conversational]*
"The wild part is the daily tracking and two assessments are completely free. I didn't pay anything for the first month. Now we do premium because we're obsessed but you don't have to."

**TEXT OVERLAY: "free. actually free."**

**0:50-0:60**
*[Direct to camera, genuine]*
"If you're in that roommate phase — or honestly even if you're good but want to be better — just try it. Five minutes. That's the ask."

**TEXT OVERLAY: "LoveRescue — link in bio"**

*[Holds eye contact with camera for a beat, then reaches to stop recording — very UGC]*

```
The 5-minute rule that got us out of the roommate phase 🏠➡️❤️

Not an ad. Just genuinely obsessed with this app.

(okay it is an ad but I'd post about it anyway because it actually works)

The daily check-in changed everything. Seeing our patterns — when we drift, what brings us back — that was the game changer.

Free to try. Link in bio.

### Production Notes
- Hire real UGC creator, not actor. Platforms: Billo, JoinBrands, or direct outreach
- Film on phone, not camera. iPhone aesthetic is the point.
- Natural lighting ONLY. No ring light.
- One take energy (can be edited from multiple takes, but should FEEL like one take)
- The stat callout should appear as a subtle, well-designed overlay — not a cheap text box. Think: New York Times data visualization aesthetic.

**Design Notes:**
- Background: Off-white or very light gradient
- Each "style" gets its own color-coded section (pink/blue/red/sage)
- Emoji icons for each type — large, eye-catching
- "Wound" text in italicized or handwriting-style font — it should feel personal, not clinical
- Overall feel: something you'd screenshot and send to 3 friends
- Font hierarchy: Bold sans-serif for fighting style, softer serif for the wound

### Caption
```
Your fighting style isn't random. It's a direct reflection of your attachment wound.

😤 THE PURSUER — You chase because you're terrified of being forgotten
🧊 THE WITHDRAWER — You shut down because feeling is dangerous  
🔥 THE VOLCANO — You explode because you don't know how to need someone safely
🪨 THE PEACEKEEPER — You avoid because conflict feels like the end

Here's the thing: these patterns were formed in childhood. They're not "who you are." They're survival strategies you learned before you had words for what you needed.

And they can change.

But first you have to see them.

Take the free attachment assessment (link in bio) — it maps your exact style and gives you specific strategies based on where you fall.

Which one are you? Drop it in the comments 👇

#attachmentstyle #fightingstyles #anxiousattachment #avoidantattachment #relationshippatterns #healingjourney #couplestherapy #loverescue
```

### Engagement Strategy
- Pin comment: "If you're a Pursuer dating a Withdrawer... 😬 you already know"
- Reply to commenters with brief insight: "Pursuer here — your anxious attachment is looking for proof you matter. That's not neediness, that's a need."
- Story repost with poll: "Pursuer or Withdrawer?" (these two will be most common)

## Content Piece 5: "POV: You Finally Understand WHY You React That Way"

**Format:** Instagram Reel / TikTok — 20-30 seconds
**Goal:** Emotional resonance, saves, virality
**Style:** Trending POV format — text overlays timed to music beats, relatable "aha moment" energy

### Trending Audio Suggestions
- "Metamorphosis" by Interworld (the one where the beat drops — HUGE on TikTok for reveal/transformation moments)
- "After Dark" by Mr. Kitty (for the more emotional, introspective version)
- "Glimpse of Us" by Joji (acoustic version, slowed — for the gut-punch emotional version)
- Any trending "realization" audio — the genre where the beat drops and text changes

### Full Script (Timed to "Metamorphosis" beat structure)

| Time | Visual | Text Overlay | Audio Beat |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Person staring at phone screen (LoveRescue results), face lit by screen glow. Slight zoom in. | **"POV: You finally understand why you react that way"** | Intro: quiet, building |
| 0:03-0:05 | Same shot, face changes — recognition. The "oh" moment. | **"Your attachment style isn't a flaw"** | Building... |
| 0:05-0:07 | **BEAT DROP** — Quick cut to text on screen, each line hitting with the beat: | **"It's a survival strategy"** | BEAT DROPS |
| 0:07-0:09 | Cut: | **"You learned it before you could talk"** | Beat continues |
| 0:09-0:11 | Cut: | **"The clinginess? Fear of abandonment."** | Beat |
| 0:11-0:13 | Cut: | **"The shutdown? Fear of engulfment."** | Beat |
| 0:13-0:15 | Cut: | **"The push-pull? Both at once."** | Beat |
| 0:15-0:18 | Slow motion: person putting phone down, looking at partner across the room. New understanding in their eyes. | **"And now that you see it..."** | Music: Shifts to emotional |
| 0:18-0:22 | Couple in warm light. Small moment — hand on hand, a real look, not performative. | **"You can finally change it."** | Music: Emotional peak |
| 0:22-0:26 | LoveRescue assessment results (blurred slightly), then app logo | **"Free attachment assessment"** → **"LoveRescue — link in bio"** | Music: Fade |

### Alternative Version (for "After Dark" audio — slower, moodier)

| Time | Visual | Text Overlay |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 0:00-0:04 | Slow zoom on person lying in bed, looking at ceiling | **"POV: You just took an attachment style assessment"** |
| 0:04-0:08 | Text appearing line by line, slowly | **"and suddenly every relationship you've ever had makes sense"** |
| 0:08-0:12 | Flashback-style quick cuts: old texts, arguments, the withdrawal, the chase | **"The pattern was always there"** |
| 0:12-0:16 | Back to person — they sit up, something shifted | **"You just couldn't see it"** |
| 0:16-0:22 | Phone screen: LoveRescue results, scrolling through insights | **"Until now"** |
| 0:22-0:26 | CTA | **"Free assessment → link in bio"** |

### Caption
```
The moment it clicks and suddenly every relationship pattern makes sense 🧬

Your attachment style isn't a personality flaw. It's a blueprint you built as a kid to stay safe. 

The problem? You're still running that program in adult relationships.

Take the free attachment assessment — 3 minutes, completely free, and it will explain more than years of wondering "why am I like this"

### Production Notes
- Two versions: "Metamorphosis" (upbeat/punchy) for TikTok virality, "After Dark" (moody/emotional) for Instagram saves
- The "aha moment" face is EVERYTHING — this needs to be genuine, not acted. Find a creator who actually takes the assessment and film their real reaction.
- Text timing is critical — every overlay should hit exactly on the beat. Off-beat text kills engagement.
- Color grade: blue/cool for "before understanding," warm/golden for "after understanding" — the visual metaphor is the story
