## Primary Text Variations (Long-Form for Facebook Feed)

### PT1: "The Minimum Effective Dose"

You don't need a couples retreat in Sedona.
You don't need a $200/hr therapist every Tuesday.
You don't need to read 14 relationship books.

You need 5 minutes a day.

That's what the research says. Gottman's Love Lab found that small, consistent moments of connection predict relationship success better than grand gestures.

Brené Brown's work on vulnerability? It's not one big confession — it's micro-moments of emotional honesty, day after day.

LoveRescue built a daily check-in around this science. Every morning, 5 minutes:

✅ How connected do you feel today? (1-10)
✅ What's your emotional weather? (mood tracking)
✅ One personalized strategy from our library of 121 expert techniques

That's it. No homework. No awkward exercises. Just 5 minutes of intentional attention.

And over time? You start seeing the patterns. When you drift apart. What brings you back. What actually works for YOUR relationship — not someone else's.

Track your mood. Track your closeness. Watch the data tell the story your feelings already know.

🔓 Daily tracking is 100% free. Start today.

### PT2: "The Compound Effect"

If you worked out for 5 minutes today, nothing would change.

If you worked out for 5 minutes every day for 6 months, everything would change.

Relationships work the same way.

Dr. John Gottman spent 40 years studying what makes relationships work. His #1 finding? It's not the big moments. It's the small bids for connection — and whether your partner turns toward them or away.

LoveRescue tracks this. Daily.

Every day, you and your partner check in. Mood. Closeness. Connection. 5 minutes, max. The app tracks your patterns over time and serves up personalized strategies from 11 of the world's top experts:

→ Gottman's "turning toward" techniques
→ Brené Brown's vulnerability practices
→ Sue Johnson's attachment exercises
→ Chris Voss's communication frameworks
→ And 7 more world-class relationship scientists

You don't need to overhaul your relationship. You need to pay attention to it. 5 minutes at a time.

Daily tracking is free. Completely free. No trial. No catch.

### PT3: "The Relationship Fitbit"

What if your relationship had a Fitbit?

Not the toxic "rate your partner" stuff. Real, science-backed tracking that helps you see what's actually happening beneath the surface.

LoveRescue gives you a daily emotional check-in:
📊 Mood tracking — how are you actually feeling?
📊 Closeness score — where's the connection level today?
📊 Pattern recognition — see your trends over weeks and months
📊 Daily strategy — one expert-backed technique, personalized to your results

It's built on research from Gottman, Brené Brown, Sue Johnson, and 8 other world-class experts. 121 techniques total. Not affirmations. Not "just communicate better." Specific, actionable strategies based on attachment science, conflict research, and real relationship data.

5 minutes a day. That's the ask.

The result? You stop guessing and start seeing. When you're drifting apart. When something's working. What YOUR relationship actually needs — backed by data, not just feelings.

Daily tracking is free. All of it.

**Format:** Vertical 9:16 + Square 1:1
**Pacing:** Calm, confident, warm. This isn't urgent — it's inviting.

**Music:** Same warm acoustic, extended. Builds from intimate to confident.

| Time | Visual | Text Overlay | Audio/VO |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Morning routine montage: coffee brewing, phone buzzing, the scroll-through-notifications moment. Relatable, not aspirational. | **"You check the weather every morning."** → **"Your email."** → **"Your Instagram."** | Soft piano, single notes |
| 0:05-0:10 | Same person pausing, looking at partner across the kitchen. A beat of real life. | **"When's the last time you checked in on THIS?"** | Piano continues, slight tension |
| 0:10-0:16 | Person opens LoveRescue. Simple, clean check-in screen. Taps through: mood (😊), closeness (7/10), quick reflection. | **"LoveRescue. 5 minutes."** → **"How are you feeling?"** → **"How connected are you?"** | Acoustic guitar joins piano |
| 0:16-0:22 | Partner's phone: same check-in. Then both results appearing side by side — you see where they align and where they don't. | **"Your partner checks in too."** → **"And the app connects the dots."** | Music: Building warmth |
| 0:22-0:30 | Data visualization: mood trends over 2 weeks, closeness graph, pattern callouts. Looks clean and insightful, not clinical. | **"See your patterns."** → **"When you drift apart."** → **"What brings you back."** | Music: Momentum |

| 0:37-0:45 | Quick-cut testimonial feel (text on screen, not UGC): "We started seeing the patterns after week 2" / "It's like a relationship weather report" / "5 minutes changed everything" | **Social proof text overlays** | Music: Emotional |
| 0:45-0:52 | Couple in real-life moments: cooking together, walking, having a real laugh. Not posed stock photo energy. | **"You don't need to overhaul your relationship."** → **"You need to pay attention to it."** | Music: Building to peak |
| 0:52-0:57 | App overview: free tier callout, clean UI shots | **"Daily tracking. 2 free assessments. Full strategy engine."** → **"All free. No catch."** | Music: Settling |

**Director's Notes:**
- This ad should feel like a morning routine — warm, habitual, calming
- Color grade: golden hour tones, warm amber, soft focus backgrounds
- The data visualization section is KEY — it should look beautiful and insightful, not clinical or scary
- Partner dynamic should feel equal — not one person "fixing" the other
- The expert name-drops should feel credible, not salesy — think "built on research from" not "ENDORSED BY"
