### PT1: "The Price Tag"

Couples therapy: $200/hr.
Minimum recommended sessions: 12-20.
Total cost: $2,400 - $4,000.
Waitlist: 4-8 weeks.
Success rate: Depends entirely on who you get.

What if the same science was available for free?

Not a chatbot that says "I hear you" and "that must be hard."
Not a meditation app that tells you to breathe.
Not a workbook with fill-in-the-blank prompts.

### PT2: "The Therapist's Dirty Secret"

Here's what most couples therapists won't tell you:

80% of what they do in session comes from the same handful of researchers. Gottman. Johnson. Brown. Levine. The techniques aren't secret. They're published. They're studied. They're proven.

What's expensive isn't the knowledge — it's the personalization. Figuring out which techniques work for YOUR specific dynamic. Your attachment style. Your conflict pattern. Your triggers.

That's exactly what LoveRescue does.

10 assessments map your relationship dynamics with clinical precision. Then the app matches you with specific techniques from 121 strategies built on research from 11 world-class experts.

Not "tips." Not "advice." The actual frameworks that therapists use — personalized to your results, delivered daily, tracked over time.

The difference between LoveRescue and therapy?

Therapy: $200/hr, 1 hour/week, 1 therapist's perspective
LoveRescue: Free to start, 5 min/day, 11 experts' combined research

We're not anti-therapy. Therapy is incredible when you need it. But you shouldn't need to spend $4,000 to understand your own attachment style.

Start with the free assessments. See what you learn. If you still want therapy after that, you'll walk in knowing exactly what to work on.

### PT3: "The Third Option"

Option A: Couples therapy.
$200/hr. 4-week waitlist. Hope you get a good one.

🧠 121 techniques from Gottman, Brown, Johnson, Perel, Voss, and 6 more
📊 Daily tracking — mood, closeness, patterns over time
🎯 Matchup dynamics — see how your styles interact with your partner's
📋 Personalized strategies — not generic, not AI-generated, expert-sourced

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA Button:** "Get the Tools — Free"
**Secondary (Stories/Reels):** "Swipe Up → Same Science, $0" / "Link in Bio"
**Landing Page:** loverescue.app/assessment
**Post-Click Flow:** "What would you normally do?" choice (therapy/Google/nothing) → Assessment → Results → "Here's what a therapist would focus on" framing

**Retargeting:**
- Clicked but didn't convert → "Still thinking about it? Your first assessment takes 3 minutes."
- Completed free assessments → "A therapist would charge $200 to tell you this. Here's the rest." (Premium pitch)
- Therapy-related interest targeting → "Before you book that $200 session..."

**Format:** Vertical 9:16 + Square 1:1
**Pacing:** Mini-documentary feel. Presents a problem, challenges an assumption, offers the alternative.
**Music:** Cinematic lo-fi. Starts contemplative, builds to confident. Think: Netflix documentary intro energy.

| Time | Visual | Text Overlay | Audio/VO |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Empty therapist's office. Two chairs. Tissue box. Clock ticking. Classic, almost cliché. | **"The average couples therapy session costs $200."** | Ambient, sparse. Clock ticking sfx. |
| 0:05-0:10 | Calculator aesthetic: $200 × 12 = $2,400. $200 × 20 = $4,000. Numbers stacking. | **"Minimum recommended: 12-20 sessions."** → **"$2,400 - $4,000."** | Low beat enters |
| 0:10-0:16 | Google search: "how to fix my relationship" — 14,000,000 results. Scroll through contradictory headlines. | **"Option B: Google it."** → **"14 million results. Zero personalization."** | Beat building |
| 0:16-0:20 | Screen: generic AI chatbot saying "I hear you. That must be difficult." Feels hollow. | **"Option C: AI chatbot."** → **"'I hear you.' Great. Now what?"** | Beat: slight humor/irony |
| 0:20-0:26 | Clean transition: LoveRescue app opens. Beautiful. Authoritative. Different. | **"Or."** (pause) → **"Same science. Better delivery."** | Music shifts: confident, purposeful |
| 0:26-0:33 | Assessment flow: attachment style questions, results, the "aha" moment of seeing your pattern mapped out | **"10 science-backed assessments"** → **"Map your attachment style."** → **"Your conflict patterns."** → **"Your exact dynamics."** | Music: Building momentum |
| 0:33-0:40 | Expert showcase: research papers, book covers, recognizable faces. Gottman, Brown, Johnson, Perel, Voss. Text feels academic but accessible. | **"Built on research from 11 world-class experts."** → **"121 techniques. Not tips. Frameworks."** | Music: Peak authority |
| 0:40-0:47 | Daily use: check-in, strategy card, trend graph. Partner comparison. Pattern recognition over time. | **"Daily tracking. Personalized strategies."** → **"Watch your patterns. Change the ones that aren't working."** | Music: Warm, practical |
| 0:47-0:52 | Side-by-side comparison (clean, not tacky): Therapy $200/hr vs LoveRescue free tier. What's included in free. | **"2 free assessments. Daily tracking. Full strategy engine."** → **"$0."** | Music: Settling |
| 0:52-0:57 | Couple in real moment — not therapy-couch energy, real-life energy. Laughing. Cooking. Being normal. | **"Your relationship isn't broken."** | Music: Emotional resolve |
| 0:57-1:00 | Logo, gradient, CTA | **"You just don't have the right tools yet."** → **"Get them →"** | Music: Powerful end |

**Director's Notes:**
- This ad should feel like it's letting you in on something. Not aggressive, but confident. "We know something you don't — and we're giving it to you."
- The therapist's office opening should feel slightly uncomfortable — we're not mocking therapy, we're questioning the accessibility model
- The AI chatbot section should feel genuinely hollow — this is a real competitor and we want the contrast to hit
- Expert section is the credibility payload — spend time here, make it look impressive
- The "isn't broken" line is the emotional climax. It should feel like relief, not a sales pitch.
- Color grade: cool/clinical for therapy office, warm for LoveRescue sections — visual storytelling through color temperature

## A/B Testing Plan

**Phase 1 (Days 1-5):** All 9 combos with 30-sec video
- $10-15/day per combo
- Optimize for: Link clicks + Assessment starts
- Special tracking: Monitor comment sentiment — this angle may be polarizing (good for engagement, watch for backlash)

**Phase 2 (Days 5-10):** Top 3 performers with both video lengths
- Optimize for: Assessment completions + App installs
- Test: "Price Tag" angle (PT1) vs "Third Option" angle (PT3) — which resonates more?

**Phase 3 (Days 10+):** Winner scaling
- This angle may work best for retargeting people who searched therapy-related terms
- Layer in interest targeting: Psychology Today readers, therapy podcast listeners, self-help book buyers
- Test: Direct comparison ads vs. "alongside therapy" positioning

**Key Metrics:**
- CTR target: >2.5% (this angle should be high-CTR due to provocative positioning)
- CPC target: <$1.25
- Assessment start rate: >45% of clicks
- Comment engagement: Track positive vs. negative sentiment
- Share rate: This ad should be shareable — target >2% share rate

## Risk Notes

This is the most aggressive angle of the three. Potential pushback:
- Therapists/therapy advocates may comment negatively → **Response strategy:** "We're not anti-therapy. We're anti-inaccessibility. Many of our users do both."
- Claims need to be defensible → All expert techniques are based on published research, we're not claiming endorsement
- Price comparison must be accurate → Use averages, cite sources, don't exaggerate

**Pre-launch checklist:**
- [ ] Legal review of therapy price comparisons
- [ ] Confirm we never claim to "replace" therapy
- [ ] Prepare comment response templates
- [ ] Set up automated hiding of toxic comments
