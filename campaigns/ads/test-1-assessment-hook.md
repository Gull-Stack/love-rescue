## Primary Text Variations (Long-Form for Facebook Feed)

### PT1: "The Pattern Breaker"

You keep having the same fight.

Not the same topic — the same *pattern*. The withdrawal. The escalation. The silence that stretches into days.

It's not because you're bad at relationships. It's because you've never had the data.

LoveRescue uses 10 science-backed assessments built on research from Gottman, Brené Brown, Sue Johnson, and 8 other world-class relationship experts to map your exact relationship dynamics.

Your attachment style. Your conflict patterns. Your love language match (and mismatch). All of it.

Not vibes. Not generic advice. Your specific blueprint.

🔓 Two assessments are completely free — attachment style + love language. No credit card. No catch.

Over 121 expert techniques, personalized to YOUR results.

Your relationship has a blueprint. Find it.

👇 Take the free assessment now

### PT2: "The Blind Spot"

Here's what nobody tells you about relationships:

You're not fighting about the dishes. You're not fighting about money. You're fighting because your nervous systems are speaking different languages.

Attachment science has known this for decades. Gottman's research confirmed it. Sue Johnson built an entire therapy model around it.

But until now, you needed a $200/hr therapist to decode it.

LoveRescue puts that same science in your pocket. 10 assessments. 121 techniques from 11 of the world's top relationship experts. Personalized strategies based on YOUR specific dynamics — not generic "communicate better" advice.

Start free. Two full assessments (attachment style + love language), daily tracking, and the complete strategy engine. No credit card required.

Stop guessing. Start understanding.

👇 Take your free assessment

### PT3: "The Numbers"

Here's a number that should scare you: 67% of relationship problems are unsolvable.

(That's Gottman's research, not ours.)

The difference between couples who thrive and couples who don't isn't *fewer* problems. It's understanding the patterns underneath them.

LoveRescue maps those patterns. 10 science-backed assessments. 121 techniques from Gottman, Brené Brown, Sue Johnson, Esther Perel, Chris Voss, and 6 more of the world's top experts in love, attachment, and human connection.

Your attachment style shapes how you fight. Your conflict pattern predicts what triggers you. Your love language determines what actually lands.

We give you all of it. And the first two assessments? Completely free.

No therapist-speak. No "just communicate better." Actual, specific, science-backed strategies for YOUR relationship.

**Director's Notes:**
- Color grade: warm tones throughout, desaturated in "problem" section, saturated in "solution" section
- The expert name section should feel like a flex — these aren't random people, these are THE names in relationships
- Assessment results should look beautiful and feel like an "aha moment"
- End card should be clean, confident, not desperate — this app doesn't need to beg
