## What Hooks Work (2026)

### ✅ HIGH PERFORMERS
- **Skit-style UGC** — relatable couple scenarios on Reels/TikTok (3-sec hook rule)
- **Problem-agitate-solve** — "My marriage was falling apart until I found..."
- **Quiz/assessment entry** — "Take this 2-min quiz" (high intent, low friction)
- **Transformation narratives** — emotional before/after
- **"Gym for your relationship"** framing — destigmatizes usage

### ❌ DEAD FORMATS
- Ring-light testimonials (CPT up, conversion down)
- Scripted influencer reads
- Feature walkthroughs with forced enthusiasm
- Generic "best relationship app" claims

### 📊 Data Points
- Tutorials/reviews = **45% higher IPM** vs testimonials (AppsFlyer 2025)

## Format Priorities (2026)

1. **Reels (15-30s)** — mandatory primary format
2. **TikTok (15-60s)** — growth channel, skit-style dominates
3. **Stories (15s)** — support format, quiz stickers work
4. **Static carousel** — for retargeting/education only
5. **Long-form (60s+)** — only for warm audiences

### Creative Velocity Target
- **3-5 new concepts per week** minimum
- Rotate every 7-10 days (creative fatigue accelerating under Meta Andromeda)
- Test hooks independently from bodies — modular creative system

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Research LoveFix deeply** — they're positioning on "conflict repair" which overlaps LoveRescue's name/positioning
2. **Build 3 skit-style Reels scripts** using problem-agitate-solve hooks
3. **Create assessment quiz ad funnel** — "See your relationship score in 2 minutes"

### Short-Term (This Month)
4. **Adopt "Relationship Wellness" framing** alongside rescue messaging — broadens TAM
5. **Explore home screen widget** (MoodMe's retention play)
6. **Test AI therapist as ad hook** — "Your relationship therapist, available 24/7" (Flamme doing similar but LoveRescue has deeper feature)

### Medium-Term (Q1 2026)
7. **B2B2C distribution via therapists/churches** — SYMBIS model proof of concept
8. **TikTok organic presence** — Paired proves this channel works for couples apps
9. **Partnership ads with couples creators** — Meta Partnership Ads + TikTok Spark Ads
