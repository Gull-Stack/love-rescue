## What Hooks Work (2026)

### ✅ HIGH PERFORMERS
- **Skit-style UGC** — relatable couple scenarios on Reels/TikTok (3-sec hook rule)
- **Problem-agitate-solve** — "My marriage was falling apart until I found..."
- **Quiz/assessment entry** — "Take this 2-min quiz" (high intent, low friction)
- **Transformation narratives** — emotional before/after
- **"Gym for your relationship"** framing — destigmatizes usage

### ❌ DEAD FORMATS
- Ring-light testimonials (CPT up, conversion down)
- Scripted influencer reads
- Feature walkthroughs with forced enthusiasm
- Generic "best relationship app" claims

### 📊 Data Points
- Tutorials/reviews = **45% higher IPM** vs testimonials (AppsFlyer 2025)

## CTAs That Convert

| CTA | Use Case | Performance |
|-----|---------|------------|
| "Try free for 7 days" | Paywall / end card | #1 overall |
| "Take the quiz" | Top-funnel | High intent capture |
| "See your relationship score" | Assessment entry | Gamified, high engagement |
| "Start your journey" | Aspirational | Mid-funnel |
| "Download free" | Awareness | Broad reach |

---

## Format Priorities (2026)

1. **Reels (15-30s)** — mandatory primary format
2. **TikTok (15-60s)** — growth channel, skit-style dominates
3. **Stories (15s)** — support format, quiz stickers work
4. **Static carousel** — for retargeting/education only
5. **Long-form (60s+)** — only for warm audiences

### Creative Velocity Target
- **3-5 new concepts per week** minimum
- Rotate every 7-10 days (creative fatigue accelerating under Meta Andromeda)
- Test hooks independently from bodies — modular creative system

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Research LoveFix deeply** — they're positioning on "conflict repair" which overlaps LoveRescue's name/positioning
2. **Build 3 skit-style Reels scripts** using problem-agitate-solve hooks
3. **Create assessment quiz ad funnel** — "See your relationship score in 2 minutes"

### Short-Term (This Month)
4. **Adopt "Relationship Wellness" framing** alongside rescue messaging — broadens TAM
5. **Explore home screen widget** (MoodMe's retention play)
6. **Test AI therapist as ad hook** — "Your relationship therapist, available 24/7" (Flamme doing similar but LoveRescue has deeper feature)

### Medium-Term (Q1 2026)
7. **B2B2C distribution via therapists/churches** — SYMBIS model proof of concept
8. **TikTok organic presence** — Paired proves this channel works for couples apps
9. **Partnership ads with couples creators** — Meta Partnership Ads + TikTok Spark Ads

## Valentine's Window Strategy (Added 2026-02-12)
- **Feb 12-15:** CPMs spike 20-40%. Run organic content only (social posts).
- **Feb 16-28:** GOLDEN WINDOW. CPMs drop, relationship intent stays high (post-V-Day reflection). Launch paid ads here.
- **Post-V-Day hooks:** "Flowers die in a week. Your communication patterns last forever." / "Valentine's Day is over. The real work starts now."

## Quiz Funnel Blueprint (Added 2026-02-12)
LoveRescue has 10+ assessments — MORE than any competitor. But they're trapped inside the app.
**The Play:**
1. Standalone web quiz at loverescue.app/quiz (Attachment Style, 5-7 questions)
2. Email gate before results
3. Results page → "Unlock full relationship profile" → app download
4. Retarget quiz completers with "Your score is waiting" ads
**Why it wins:** Paired has 1 weekly quiz. Lasting has 1 onboarding assessment. We have 12. Nobody else can run this play at our depth.

## Coral Rebrand Alert (2026-02-12)
Coral rebranded from "Intimacy for Couples" → "Couples & Relationship" — expanding into our TAM. Their Apple awards (App of the Day, Valentine's Essentials) give them visibility. Their "make connection a daily habit" micro-habit framing is effective.

## Report Log
| Date | Key Findings |
|------|-------------|
| 2026-02-12 | Coral rebrand expanding TAM. Post-V-Day golden window (Feb 16-28) identified. Quiz funnel blueprint created. Lasting at $30/mo proves premium pricing works. Paired rebrand push active. Meta Andromeda = creative velocity > audience targeting. |
| 2026-02-11 | Initial report. LoveFix identified as new competitor. UGC testimonials dead — skit-style Reels dominate. Assessment quiz funnels = high-intent CTA. Flamme's "gym for relationships" framing worth adopting. |
