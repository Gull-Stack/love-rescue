## THE 4-STAGE MODEL: Assess → Learn → Practice → Transform

Every expert's work maps to this journey. The genius is knowing WHICH expert to deploy at WHICH stage, personalized to the user's assessment profile.

---

## STAGE 1: ASSESS (Weeks 0-1) — "See Yourself Clearly"

**Purpose**: Build self-awareness. No change yet — just honest observation.

### Expert Contributions to Assessment

| Expert | What They Assess | LoveRescue Assessment |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Attachment Theory** | Attachment style (secure/anxious/avoidant/fearful-avoidant) | ✅ Exists (free tier) |
| **Chapman** | Love language (giving + receiving) | ✅ Exists (free tier) |
| **Gottman** | Four Horsemen presence, bid response rate, friendship quality, conflict style, shared meaning | ✅ Partial (Gottman assessment exists) |
| **Johnson** | Pursue-withdraw position, primary vs. reactive emotions, A.R.E. accessibility | ⚠️ Partial (EFT assessment) |
| **Brown** | Armor patterns, shame triggers, vulnerability capacity | ❌ MISSING — needs Shame Resilience Assessment |
| **Robbins** | Dominant needs (which of 6), current vehicles, polarity balance | ❌ MISSING — needs Human Needs Assessment |
| **Perel** | Security-desire balance, erotic vs. domestic identity, individual vs. merged | ❌ MISSING — needs Desire & Aliveness Assessment |
| **Voss** | Communication effectiveness, listening quality, empathy accuracy | ⚠️ Partial (PREP assessment covers some) |

### Assessment-to-Profile Mapping

After all assessments, each user gets a **Relationship Profile**:
```
{
  attachmentStyle: "anxious",           // Levine/Tatkin
  loveLanguage: "quality_time",         // Chapman
  cyclePosition: "pursuer",             // Johnson
  dominantHorseman: "criticism",        // Gottman
  armorPattern: "perfectionism",        // Brown
  dominantNeed: "significance",         // Robbins
  desireStyle: "merged",               // Perel
  communicationGap: "listening"         // Voss
}
```

This profile drives EVERYTHING in stages 2-4.

---

## STAGE 2: LEARN (Weeks 1-2) — "Understand Your Patterns"

**Purpose**: Education. Connect what you discovered in assessment to WHY you do what you do. Deprogramming through understanding.

### Learning Pathways by Profile

**If Anxious Attachment + Pursuer + Criticism:**
1. Learn: Your protest behaviors are attachment-driven, not character flaws (Levine)
2. Learn: Criticism is the surface — underneath is loneliness and fear of abandonment (Johnson)
3. Learn: Your pursuing behavior triggers your partner's withdrawal, creating the exact outcome you fear (Johnson/Gottman)
4. Learn: "The story I'm telling myself" technique to catch catastrophic narratives (Brown)
5. Learn: Your need for certainty and connection is valid — the VEHICLE (criticism) is the problem, not the need (Robbins)

**If Avoidant Attachment + Withdrawer + Stonewalling:**
1. Learn: Your withdrawal is a deactivating strategy, not strength — it's fear wearing independence as a mask (Levine)
2. Learn: Stonewalling triggers your partner's anxiety spiral — your "peace" creates their "panic" (Gottman/Johnson)
3. Learn: Vulnerability is not weakness — it's the only path to the connection you secretly want (Brown)
4. Learn: "Needing someone isn't dependency — it's biology" (Johnson)
5. Learn: Your need for certainty (independence = control) can be met while staying connected (Robbins)

**If Secure + Words of Affirmation + No Dominant Horseman:**
1. Learn: Your security is a gift — use it to be the emotional anchor during partner's activation (Tatkin)
2. Learn: Don't mistake stability for "done growing" — complacency kills (Perel)
3. Learn: Desire needs mystery — cultivate your individual self (Perel)
4. Learn: Keep updating Love Maps — your partner is changing; keep learning them (Gottman)

### Learning Modalities
Each lesson should be delivered as:
- **Insight card** (30-second read) — the principle
- **"Why it works" explanation** (2-minute read) — the psychology
- **Self-reflection prompt** (journal) — personal application
- **Expert quote** — authority and credibility

---

## STAGE 3: PRACTICE (Weeks 2-5) — "Build New Muscle"

**Purpose**: Daily micro-practices that build new neural pathways. Small, specific, timed.

### The Daily Practice Architecture

Every day has 3 layers:

#### Layer 1: POSITIVE LENS (Non-negotiable, every day, every user)
- Source: Gottman 5:1 ratio + Chapman love language
- Duration: 2 minutes
- Example: "Write down one specific thing your partner did right today. Be detailed."
- WHY: Rewires the brain's negativity bias. The foundation everything else builds on.

#### Layer 2: SKILL PRACTICE (Personalized to profile)
- Duration: 3-5 minutes
- Rotates through expert-specific techniques based on assessment results

**Skill Practice Menu by Profile:**

| Profile Element | Week 2 Skill | Week 3 Skill | Week 4 Skill | Week 5 Skill |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Anxious** | Self-soothing pause (60s before reacting) | "Is this anxiety or intuition?" journal | Direct need expression: "I need ___" | Building identity outside relationship |
| **Avoidant** | Stay 5 min longer before withdrawing | One vulnerable disclosure per day | "What am I protecting myself from?" | Initiating connection unprompted |
| **Pursuer** | Replace criticism with "I feel ___ because I need ___" | Voss mirroring: repeat their last 3 words | Give partner space without interpreting it as rejection | Self-validate before seeking partner validation |
| **Withdrawer** | Name the emotion before retreating | "I need 20 min, I'll come back" (Gottman) | Return and re-engage after break | Share one feeling unprompted daily |
| **Criticism pattern** | Swap "You always..." → "I feel...when...because I need..." | Gottman softened startup | Voss: label their emotion before stating yours | Appreciation before complaint (5:1) |
| **Contempt pattern** | Culture of appreciation: 3 specific appreciations/day | Study your partner's strengths (Gottman fondness/admiration) | Catch contemptuous thoughts → reframe | Build shared meaning: "What do WE stand for?" |
| **Defensiveness pattern** | Accept 2% responsibility in every complaint | "What's valid about what they're saying?" | Voss: "You're right about..." then add your perspective | Practice receiving feedback as data, not attack |
| **Stonewalling pattern** | Physiological self-soothing (HR monitoring) | Announce breaks: "I need 20 min to calm down" | Return within 30 min and re-engage | Practice staying present when uncomfortable |

#### Layer 3: CONNECTION RITUAL (Personalized to love language)
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Source: Chapman + Gottman rituals of connection

| Love Language | Daily Ritual |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Words of Affirmation** | Write/text one specific appreciation (character, not appearance) |
| **Acts of Service** | Do one unrequested helpful thing |
| **Receiving Gifts** | Give one small thoughtful token (could be free — a note, a flower from the yard) |
| **Quality Time** | 10 minutes of phone-free, face-to-face conversation |
| **Physical Touch** | Gottman's 6-second kiss + 20-second hug |

---

## STAGE 4: TRANSFORM (Week 6+) — "This Is Who You Are Now"

**Purpose**: Integration. The practices become identity. The new patterns become default.

### Transformation Markers

Each expert provides a "you've arrived" signal:

| Expert | Transformation Marker |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Gottman** | 5:1 ratio maintained naturally. Repair attempts land consistently. Bids get turned toward >80% |
| **Johnson** | Can access primary emotions in real-time. Pursue-withdraw cycle interrupted automatically |
| **Brown** | Can say "the story I'm telling myself is..." mid-conflict without prompting |
| **Voss** | Partner says "That's right" (not "You're right") during discussions |
| **Chapman** | Speaking partner's language is automatic, not effortful |
| **Robbins** | Identity shift: "I am someone who..." statements feel true |
| **Perel** | Maintain individual mystery AND deep connection simultaneously |
| **Attachment** | Earned secure behaviors: can self-soothe AND reach for partner |

### Post-Cycle Architecture

After the initial 6-week cycle:
1. **Reassess**: Retake assessments. Measure change.
2. **Identify next growth edge**: What shifted? What's still stuck?
3. **Generate Cycle 2**: Deeper techniques for remaining patterns
4. **Maintenance mode**: Ongoing daily micro-rituals (2-3 min) to sustain gains

### The Maintenance Ritual Stack (Post-Transform)
Daily (total: 10 minutes):
1. **Morning**: "Today I choose to be [identity statement]" (Robbins) — 30 seconds
2. **Midday**: One appreciation text in partner's love language (Chapman) — 1 minute
3. **Evening reunion**: 6-second kiss + "How was your day?" with full presence (Gottman/Tatkin) — 5 minutes
4. **Before bed**: "The story I'm telling myself about us is..." journal (Brown) — 3 minutes
