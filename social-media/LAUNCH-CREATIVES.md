## CREATIVE 1: Pain-First (Test First — Highest Predicted CTR)
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook Feed
**Hook:** "We had the same fight again last night. Same words. Same ending. Same silence."
**Body:** 
I used to think we just weren't compatible.

Turns out, I was running the same pattern on repeat — and I didn't even know it.

I took a free 5-minute attachment style assessment and saw myself clearly for the first time.

Anxious attachment. That's why I chase. That's why the silence kills me. That's why I blow up small things.

Knowing didn't fix everything. But it stopped me from blaming my partner for MY pattern.

Free assessment → loverescue.app
**CTA:** Learn More → loverescue.app
**Angle:** Specific pain → self-discovery → free tool
**Why it should work:** First-person story creates identification. "Same fight" is universal. Attachment style is intriguing. Free removes friction.

## CREATIVE 2: Curiosity Hook
**Hook:** "There's a ratio that predicts divorce with 94% accuracy. I checked mine."
**Body:**
Dr. John Gottman studied 3,000 couples over 40 years.

He found that couples who maintain a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions stay together.

Below 5:1? The relationship is dying — even if it doesn't feel like it yet.

I started tracking mine. Day 1: 2:1. Ouch.

Week 3: 6:1. Not because my partner changed — because I did.

Track yours free → loverescue.app
**CTA:** Learn More → loverescue.app
**Angle:** Scientific curiosity → data-driven self-improvement
**Why it should work:** Specific number (94%) stops scrollers. The ratio is shareable. "Because I did" reinforces creator mindset.

---

## CREATIVE 3: Identity Hook
**Hook:** "For couples who are done reading relationship advice and ready to actually do the work"
**Body:**
Not therapy. Not another "10 tips to communicate better" article.

A system.

12 science-backed assessments that show you YOUR patterns.
Daily tracking that builds the habits that actually change relationships.
Personalized strategies based on YOUR results — not generic advice.

This is for people who want to look in the mirror, not point fingers.

Start free → loverescue.app
**CTA:** Sign Up → loverescue.app
**Angle:** Identity filtering — "this is for serious people, not browsers"
**Why it should work:** Filters hard for high-intent. "Mirror not finger" is the core philosophy. Positions against generic advice (which they've all tried).

---

## CREATIVE 4: Social Proof / Outcome
**Hook:** "My wife asked why I was suddenly better at arguing"
**Body:**
She literally said: "What happened to you?"

I didn't tell her about the app at first. I just... started doing things differently.

Pausing before reacting.
Actually hearing her instead of planning my defense.
Noticing when I was triggered vs when I was just tired.

3 weeks of daily tracking and one attachment style assessment. That's all it took to break a 4-year pattern.

She's on it now too. Our matchup score last week? 87%.

loverescue.app — free to start
**CTA:** Learn More → loverescue.app
**Angle:** Third-person validation through partner's reaction
**Why it should work:** The partner noticing = ultimate social proof. "What happened to you?" is the dream outcome. Specific timeline (3 weeks) makes it believable.

---

## CREATIVE 5: Myth Buster
**Hook:** "Couples therapy didn't work for us. This did."
**Body:**
$200/hour. Every Thursday. For 8 months.

We'd talk about our problems for 50 minutes, then go home and repeat them.

Nothing changed because we were focused on the RELATIONSHIP instead of OURSELVES.

Love Rescue flipped it. Each person works on THEIR patterns. THEIR triggers. THEIR attachment style.

Turns out when two people fix themselves, the relationship fixes itself.

Free assessments → loverescue.app
**CTA:** Learn More → loverescue.app
**Angle:** Contrarian — therapy doesn't work, self-work does
**Why it should work:** Controversial hook stops scrollers. $200/hour is relatable pain. Philosophy matches the app's core differentiator.
