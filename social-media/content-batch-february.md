# Love Rescue Content Batch — February 2026

## QUICK TIPS (15 posts)

### Tip 1
```
The 6-second kiss.

Dr. Gottman found that couples who kiss for 6+ seconds daily report higher relationship satisfaction.

Not a peck. A real one.

Try it tonight. Report back. 💋

#relationshiptips #gottmanmethod #couplesgoals
```

### Tip 2
```
Stop asking "How was your day?"

Start asking:
→ "What made you laugh today?"
→ "What stressed you out?"
→ "What are you looking forward to tomorrow?"

Better questions = better connection.

#communicationtips #relationships #intimacy
```

### Tip 3
```
The 5:1 ratio.

For every negative interaction, you need FIVE positive ones to stay healthy.

One criticism? Balance it with:
✓ A compliment
✓ A thank you
✓ Physical affection
✓ Active listening
✓ A small gesture

Math matters in love. 📊

#relationshipadvice #healthyrelationships
```

### Tip 4
```
"I feel [emotion] when [situation] because [need]."

That's it. That's the formula.

Not: "You always ignore me."
Try: "I feel lonely when we're on our phones at dinner because I need quality time with you."

Game changer. 🎯

#communicationskills #coupletips
```

### Tip 5
```
Touch your partner 8x today.

Not all sexual. Just connection:
- Hand on back walking by
- Squeeze their shoulder
- Hold hands in the car
- Hug from behind
- High five for no reason

Physical touch is a language. Speak it fluently.

#lovelanguages #intimacy #relationshipgoals
```

### Tip 6
```
The 10-minute rule:

First 10 minutes when you reunite = NO complaints, logistics, or problems.

Just:
"Hey, I missed you."
"How are you feeling?"
"Tell me something good."

Protect the reconnection. 🏠

#marriageadvice #datingtips
```

### Tip 7
```
When you're wrong, say these 8 words:

"You're right. I'm sorry. I'll do better."

No "but."
No explaining.
No deflecting.

Just accountability.

Repair is a superpower. 💪

#relationshiptips #emotionalintelligence
```

### Tip 8
```
Bids for connection:

"Look at this!" = bid
"Ugh, work was rough" = bid
*sigh* = bid

You can:
✓ Turn toward (engage)
✗ Turn away (ignore)
✗ Turn against (criticize)

Start noticing. Start turning toward.

#gottmanmethod #relationshipscience
```

### Tip 9
```
Weekly questions to ask your partner:

1. How are WE doing?
2. What do you need more of from me?
3. What should we do differently?
4. What are you excited about?
5. How can I support you this week?

Schedule it. Sunday nights work great. 📅

#couplesgoals #intentionalliving
```

### Tip 10
```
The soft startup:

Wrong: "You NEVER help around here!"
Right: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with housework. Can we figure this out together?"

How you start the conversation predicts how it ends.

96% of the time.

Start soft. 🌱

#conflictresolution #communicationtips
```

### Tip 11
```
Your partner is not a mind reader.

Say the thing.
Ask for what you need.
Stop the silent tests.

"I wish they would just KNOW" is a fantasy.

Clear is kind. 💬

#relationshipadvice #healthycommunication
```

### Tip 12
```
Daily gratitude, out loud:

"Thank you for making coffee."
"I appreciate you handling that."
"I'm grateful you're my person."

What gets appreciated gets repeated.

Say it. Every day. ✨

#gratitude #marriedlife #lovelanguages
```

### Tip 13
```
The 2-minute check-in:

Every morning, ask:
"What's one thing on your mind today?"

Every night, ask:
"What was the best part of your day?"

2 minutes. Massive impact.

We built an app for this btw 😉

#dailycheckin #couplegoals #loverescue
```

### Tip 14
```
Fighting fair rules:

✓ No name-calling
✓ No bringing up old stuff
✓ Take breaks when flooded
✓ Use "I" statements
✓ Attack the problem, not the person

You're teammates, not opponents.

#conflictresolution #relationshiptips
```

### Tip 15
```
The magic ratio for hard conversations:

70% listening
20% validating
10% problem-solving

Most people flip this.

Listen first. Fix later.

## MYTH BUSTING (10 posts)

### Myth 1
```
MYTH: "If it's real love, it should be easy."

TRUTH: Real love is a skill you build.

Every couple struggles. 
The good ones just keep showing up.

Hard ≠ wrong. 💪

#relationshipmyths #realtalklove
```

### Myth 2
```
MYTH: "Happy couples don't fight."

TRUTH: Happy couples fight BETTER.

They repair faster.
They don't go for the jugular.
They remember they're on the same team.

Conflict is inevitable. Damage is optional.

#marriageadvice #healthyrelationships
```

### Myth 3
```
MYTH: "You complete me."

TRUTH: Two whole people build the best relationships.

Your partner is not responsible for your happiness.
Your healing.
Your fulfillment.

Do your own work. Then share your wholeness.

#attachmentstyle #personalgrowth
```

### Myth 4
```
MYTH: "Passion fades — that's just how it goes."

TRUTH: Passion needs maintenance, not magic.

Date nights.
Novelty.
Curiosity about your partner.
Physical touch.

You can fan the flame. It just takes intention. 🔥

#keepingthesparkalive #longtermlove
```

### Myth 5
```
MYTH: "If they loved me, they'd change."

TRUTH: People change when THEY want to, not when you want them to.

You can:
→ Express needs
→ Set boundaries
→ Model growth

You can't:
→ Force change
→ love someone into being different

Accept or leave. Control isn't love.

#boundaries #relationshipadvice
```

### Myth 6
```
MYTH: "Couples therapy is for failing relationships."

TRUTH: The healthiest couples go BEFORE crisis.

Tune-ups > tow trucks.

Why wait until you're broken?

#couplestherapy #preventativecare
```

### Myth 7
```
MYTH: "We're just not compatible."

TRUTH: Compatibility is built, not found.

Similar values? Important.
Same taste in movies? Irrelevant.

Successful couples create compatibility through effort, respect, and shared experiences.

#compatibilitymyth #relationshipwork
```

### Myth 8
```
MYTH: "They should just KNOW what I need."

TRUTH: No one is psychic. Including your partner.

Unexpressed expectations are just planned resentments.

Use your words. 💬

#communicationtips #relationshipmyths
```

### Myth 9
```
MYTH: "Love means never having to say you're sorry."

TRUTH: This might be the worst relationship advice ever written.

Love means saying sorry WELL and OFTEN.

Apologize. Repair. Reconnect.

#apologize #relationshiprepair
```

### Myth 10
```
MYTH: "Relationship problems mean something is wrong with US."

TRUTH: Every relationship has problems. Every single one.

69% of relationship conflicts are unsolvable (Gottman research).

The goal isn't to fix everything.
It's to manage, accept, and keep choosing each other.

## RELATABLE MOMENTS (10 posts)

### Relatable 1
```
POV: You finally bring up The Thing you've been avoiding

And they say "I've been feeling that too."

🥹🥹🥹

#coupleproblems #relatable #relationships
```

### Relatable 2
```
The cycle:

1. Get annoyed at partner
2. Don't say anything
3. Get more annoyed
4. Still don't say anything  
5. Explode over something tiny
6. "Where did THAT come from??"

Just me? 🙃

(Say the thing earlier, friends)

#relatable #couplesbelike
```

### Relatable 3
```
Love languages in the wild:

Words of affirmation: "Tell me I'm pretty"
Quality time: "Put your phone DOWN"
Acts of service: "You emptied the dishwasher?? 😍"
Gifts: "You remembered!"
Physical touch: *attaches self to partner*

Tag your partner with their language 👇

#lovelanguages #couplegoals
```

### Relatable 4
```
"We need to talk"

*entire life flashes before eyes*

It was about dinner plans.

#anxiousattachment #relatable #coupleshumor
```

### Relatable 5
```
Anxious attachment: *texts partner* "are we okay?"

Avoidant attachment: *needs 3 business days to process feelings*

Secure attachment: "I'm feeling disconnected, can we talk tonight?"

Healing is possible for all of us. 💕

#attachmentstyles #healingjourney
```

### Relatable 6
```
Things that feel romantic after 5 years:

- They let you pick the show
- Full tank of gas
- "I already ate, but I'll sit with you"
- Remembering your coffee order
- "I handled it"

Romance evolves. And it's beautiful. ✨

#longtermlove #marriedlife
```

### Relatable 7
```
How fights start:

10% actual problem
90% tone of voice

😅

#relatable #couplesbelike #communicationfail
```

### Relatable 8
```
"I'm fine."

Narrator: They were not fine.

Check in on your "fine" partner today. 💕

#relationships #emotionalintelligence
```

### Relatable 9
```
The apology languages:

- "I'm sorry"
- "I was wrong"
- "How can I fix this?"
- "I won't do it again"
- *acts of service for the next week*

We all receive apologies differently.
Learn your partner's language.

#apology #relationshiptips
```

### Relatable 10
```
Stages of a relationship argument:

1. The Issue
2. The Tangent
3. That thing from 2019
4. Complete silence
5. "...you hungry?"
6. Makeup snacks

Tale as old as time. 🍕

## TIKTOK SCRIPTS (5 videos)

### TikTok 1 — "Relationship green flags"
```
[Hook text on screen]: "Green flags your relationship is healthy"

[Speaking]:
"Number 1: You can be silent together without it being weird.

Number 2: They ask follow-up questions about your day.

Number 3: Apologies come with changed behavior, not just words.

Number 4: You're excited to tell them good news.

Number 5: You fight WITH each other against the problem, not against each other.

How many did you get? Comment below."
```

### TikTok 2 — "Things I wish I knew"
```
[Hook]: "Things I wish I knew before my first serious relationship"

[Speaking]:
"Your partner is not responsible for your happiness. That's YOUR job.

Attraction fluctuates. Commitment shouldn't.

'Not fighting' doesn't mean 'healthy.' Sometimes it means avoidance.

The right person still requires effort.

And finally — love is a verb. It's something you DO, not just something you feel.

Would've saved myself a lot of heartbreak."
```

### TikTok 3 — "Hot take"
```
[Hook]: "Hot take about relationships that shouldn't be hot"

[Speaking]:
"Checking in with your partner daily is not 'too much.'

It's literally the bare minimum.

'How are you feeling? How are WE feeling?'

Takes 2 minutes. Changes everything.

We actually built an app for this — link in bio — but honestly just START doing it. Your relationship will thank you."
```

### TikTok 4 — "Anxious attachment be like"
```
[Hook]: "Anxious attachment in relationships"

[POV acting]:
*Texts sent*
*Immediately watches typing indicator*
*Indicator disappears*
*Panic*
"They're breaking up with me"
*Phone buzzes*
"Running late, love you!"
*Relief floods in*

[Speaking to camera]:
"If this is you — first, you're not crazy. Second, it's healable. Learning about attachment styles changed my whole life.

Secure attachment is possible. I promise."
```

### TikTok 5 — "Unpopular opinion"
```
[Hook]: "Unpopular relationship opinion"

[Speaking]:
"You should go to couples therapy BEFORE you need it.

Why do we wait until things are on fire?

Regular check-ins with a professional.
Or at minimum, regular check-ins with each other.

Prevention > crisis management.

Your relationship is worth the maintenance."
```
