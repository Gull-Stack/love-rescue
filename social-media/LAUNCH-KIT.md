### Post 3 — TikTok Script
```
[Hook - on screen text]: "Things therapists wish couples knew"

[Speaking to camera]:
"Number one: The goal isn't to never fight. 
It's to fight WELL.

Number two: Your partner can't read your mind. 
Stop testing them.

Number three: Daily check-ins beat monthly blowups. 
Every. Single. Time.

We built an app for that last one. Link in bio."
```

### Post 4 — Engagement Post
**Instagram:**
```
Real talk: What's the hardest part of your relationship right now?

Drop a 💬 if it's communication
Drop a ⏰ if it's quality time
Drop a 🔥 if it's keeping the spark alive
Drop a 🏠 if it's household stuff

No judgment. We're all figuring it out. 💕
