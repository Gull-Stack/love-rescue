# Creative Variation Engine

## How to Use
In the LoveRescue Telegram group, say:

**"@DonaldJayBot generate hooks: [paste your winning hook]"**

Donald Jay will generate 100 variations in 5 categories:
- 20 pain-first hooks (lead with the problem)
- 20 solution-first hooks (lead with the outcome)
- 20 social proof hooks (lead with numbers/testimonials)
- 20 curiosity hooks (create open loops)
- 20 identity hooks (speak to who they ARE)

## Rules
- Every hook must be specific enough to FILTER for high-intent buyers
- No generic hooks ("Check this out", "You'll love this")
- Each hook should make someone WITH the problem stop scrolling
- Each hook should make someone WITHOUT the problem keep scrolling
- Output as numbered list, copy-pasteable into a spreadsheet
