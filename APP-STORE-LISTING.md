## Description

LoveRescue is the relationship growth app built on research from the world's top relationship experts — Gottman, Sue Johnson, Brené Brown, Chris Voss, Esther Perel, Tony Robbins, Stan Tatkin, and Gary Chapman.

Whether you're working on your relationship solo or together with your partner, LoveRescue gives you a personalized 6-week strategy grounded in real science — not generic advice.

HOW IT WORKS

1. ASSESS — Take research-backed assessments (Gottman, Attachment Style, Love Language, EFT, and more) to understand your relationship patterns.

2. MATCH — Invite your partner to compare results. See where you align, where you miss, and what to focus on first.

3. GROW — Get a personalized 6-week strategy with daily activities, expert insights, and progress tracking. Every activity includes the "why" behind it — backed by citations from leading researchers.

WHAT MAKES LOVERESCUE DIFFERENT

• Expert-Backed, Not Generic — Every strategy draws from peer-reviewed research. You'll learn techniques from Gottman's Sound Relationship House, Johnson's Emotionally Focused Therapy, Voss's tactical empathy, and more.
