## Description
Love Rescue helps you understand yourself, your partner, and your relationship through science-backed assessments — so you can stop guessing and start growing.

**The problem is simple:** most relationships don't fail from lack of love. They fail from lack of awareness. You don't know your attachment style. You misread your partner's needs. Small disconnections pile up until they feel impossible to fix.

**Love Rescue changes that.**

Take 12 clinically-informed assessments rooted in the work of Dr. John Gottman, Dr. Amir Levine, Dr. Susan Johnson, Dr. Gary Chapman, and other leading relationship researchers. Each assessment reveals a different dimension of how you connect — and where you get stuck.

**ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE:**
• Attachment Style — Are you secure, anxious, avoidant, or fearful?
• Gottman Relationship Health — The Four Horsemen, friendship, and fondness
• Love Languages — How you give and receive love
• Emotional Intelligence (EQ) — Self-awareness, empathy, and regulation
• Conflict Resolution Style — How you fight matters more than what you fight about
• Communication Patterns — Identify blind spots in how you talk and listen
• Trust & Safety — The foundation everything else is built on
• Intimacy & Connection — Physical and emotional closeness
• Shared Values & Vision — Are you building the same future?
• Relationship Satisfaction — Your overall happiness and fulfillment
• Stress & Coping — How external pressure affects your bond
• Boundaries & Independence — Healthy togetherness starts with healthy separateness

**POWERFUL FEATURES:**
◆ Daily Relationship Tracker — Log your connection, mood, and moments in seconds
◆ Matchup Scores — Invite your partner and see how your profiles align
◆ Personalized Strategies — Get actionable tips based on your unique results
◆ Progress Over Time — Watch your scores evolve as you grow
◆ Partner Dashboard — Compare results side-by-side and spark real conversations
◆ Beautiful, Private, Secure — Your data stays yours. Always.

**BUILT ON REAL SCIENCE:**
Every assessment is grounded in peer-reviewed research and established therapeutic frameworks. We translate decades of clinical insight into something you can use in five minutes on your phone.

Love Rescue isn't therapy — it's the self-awareness that makes therapy (and everyday life) work better.

**START FREE:**

Your relationship deserves more than guesswork. Give it Love Rescue.
