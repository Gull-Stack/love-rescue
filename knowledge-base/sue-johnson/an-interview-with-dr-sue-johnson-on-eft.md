I want to talk a little bit today about
Labor and
work when we think about how people work
the naive intuition we have is that
people are like rats in a maze that all
people care about is money and the
moment we give people money we can
direct them to work one way we can
direct them to work another way this is
why we give bonuses to bankers and pay
in all kinds of ways and we really have
this incredibly simplistic view of why
people work and what the labor market
looks like at the same time if you think
about it there's all kinds of Strange
Behaviors in the world around us think
about something like mountaineering and
mountain climbing if you read books of
people who climb mountains difficult
mountains do you think that those books
are full of moments of joy and happiness
no they're full of misery in fact it's
all about Frost bites and difficulty to
walk and difficulty of breathing cold
challenging circumstances and if people
were just trying to be happy the moment
they would get to the top they would say
this was a terrible mistake I'll never
do it
again instead let me sit on a beach
somewhere drinking Mojitos but instead
people go down down and after they
recover they go up again and if you
think about mountain climbing as an
example it suggest all kinds of things
it suggests that we care about reaching
the end a peak it suggests that we care
about the fight about the challenge it
suggest that there's all kinds of other
things that motivate us to work or
behave in all kinds of ways and for me
personally I started thinking about this
after a student came to visit me this
was a student that was a one of my
students a few years earlier and he came
one day back to campus and he told me
the following story he said that for
more than two weeks he was working on a
PowerPoint presentation he was working
in a big bank and this was in
preparation for merger and
acquisition and he was working very hard
on this presentation graphs tables
information he stayed late at night
every day and the day before it was due
he sent his PowerPoint presentation to
his boss and his boss wrote him back and
said nice presentation but the merger is
cancelled and the guy was deeply
depressed now at the moment when he was
working he was actually quite happy
every night he was enjoying his work he
was staying late he was perfecting this
PowerPoint presentation but knowing that
nobody would ever watch that made him
quite depressed so I thought started
thinking about how do we experiment with
this idea of the fruits of our
labor and to start with we created a
little
experiment in which we gave people Legos
and we asked them to build
Legos and for some people we gave them a
Lego and we said hey would you like to
build this Bionicle for $3 we'll pay you
$3 for it and people said yes and they
build this Lego and when they finished
we took it we put it under the table and
we said would you like to build another
one this time for 270 if they said yes
we gave them another one and when they
finished we asked them do you want to
build another one for 240 210 and so on
until at some point people said no more
it's not worth it for
me this was what we call the meaningful
condition people build one Bionicle
after another after they finished every
one of them we put put them under the
table and we told them that at the end
of the experiment we will take all these
Bionicles we will unassemble them we
will put them back in the boxes and we
will use it for the next
participant there was another condition
this other condition was inspired by
David my student and this other
condition we call the cific condition
and if you remember the story about
Copus Copus was punished by the gods to
put this to push the same Rock up a hill
and when he almost got got to the end
The Rock will roll over and he would
have to start again and you can think
about this as the essence of doing
futile work you can imagine that if he
pushed the rock on different Hills at
least he would have some sense of
progress also if you look at prison
movies sometimes the way that the guards
torture the prisoners is to get them to
dig a hole and when the prisoners finish
they asked them to fill the hole back up
and then dig again there's something
about this cyclical version of doing
something over and over and over that
seems to be particularly
demotivating so in the second condition
of this experiment that's exactly what
we did we asked people would you like to
build one Bionicle for $3 and if they
said yes they build it and we then we
asked them do you want to build another
one for 270 and if they said yes we gave
them a new one and as they were building
it we took apart the one that they just
finished and when they finished that we
said would would you like to build
another one this time for 30 cents less
and if they said yes we gave them the
one that they built and we broke so this
was an endless cycle of them building
and we destroying in front of their
eyes now what happens when you compare
these two conditions the first thing
that happened was that people build many
more Bionicles they build 11 versus 7 in
the meaningful condition versus the
sisifus condition and by the way we
should point out that this was not big
meaning people were not curing cancer or
Building Bridges people were building
Bionicles for a few a few cents and not
only that everybody knew that the
Bionicles will be destroyed sooner quite
soon right so there was not a real
opportunity for big meaning but even the
small meaning made a
difference now we had another version of
this experiment in this other version of
the experiment we didn't put people in
this situation we just described to them
the situation much I'm describing to you
now and we asked them to predict what
the result would be what happened people
predicted the right direction but not
the right magnitude people who were just
given the description of the
experiment said that in the meaningful
condition people would probably build
one more Bionicle so people understand
that meaning is important they just
don't understand the magnitude of the
importance the extent to which it's
important there was one other piece of
data we looked at if you think about it
there are some people who love Legos and
some people who don't and you would
speculate that the people who love Lego
will build more Legos even for less
money because after all they get more
internal Joy from it and the people who
love Legos less will build less logos
because the enjoyment that they derive
from it is lower and that's actually
what we found in a meaningful condition
there was a very nice correlation
between love of Lego and the amount of
Legos people built what happened in the
cific condition in that condition the
correlation was Zero there was no
relationship between the love of Lego
and how much people built which suggest
to me that with this manipulation of
breaking things in front of people eyes
we basically crushed any joy that they
could get out of this activity we
basically eliminated
that soon after I finished uh running
this experiment I went to talk to a big
software company in
Seattle can't tell you who they were but
they were a big company in
Seattle and this was a group within the
software company that was put in a
different building and they asked them
to innovate and create the next big
product for this company and a week
before I showed up the CEO of this big
software company went to that group 200
engineers and cancelled the
project and I stood there in front of
200 of the most depressed people I've
ever talked to and I described to them
some of these Lego experiments and they
said they have felt like they have just
been through this
experiment and I asked them I said how
many of you now show to work later than
you used to and everybody raised their
hand I said how many of you now go home
earlier than you used to everybody
raised their hand I asked him how many
of you now add not so koser thing to
your expense reports and they didn't
really raise their hand but they took me
out to dinner and showed me what they
could do with the expense
reports and then I asked him I said what
could the CEO have done to make you not
as depressed
and they came up with all kinds of ideas
they said the CEO could have asked them
to present to the whole company about
their Journey over the last two years
and why they decide to do he could have
asked them to think about which aspect
of their technology could fit with other
parts of the organization he could have
asked them to build some prototype some
Next Generation prototype and see how
they would work but the thing is that
any one of those would require some
effort and motivation and I think the
CEO basically did not understand the
importance of meaning if the CEO just
like our participants thought that the
essence of meaning is unimportant then
he wouldn't care and he would tell well
the moment you I directed you in this
way and now I'm starting directing You
In This way everything would be okay but
if you understood how important meaning
is then you would figure out that it's
actually important to spend some time
energy and effort and getting people to
care more about what they're
doing the next experiment was slightly
different we took a sheet of paper with
random letters and we asked people to
find pairs of letters that were
identical next to each other that was
the task and people did the first sheet
and then we asked them if they want to
do the next sheet for a little bit less
money and the next sheet for a little
bit less money and so on and so forth
and we had three conditions in the first
condition people wrote the name on the
sheet found all the pairs of letters
gave it to the experimental the
experimental would look at it scan it
from top to bottom say uhhuh and put it
on the pile next next to them in the
second condition people did not write
their name on it the experiment looked
at it took the sheet of paper did not
look at it did not scan it and simply
put it on a pile of pages right so you
take a piece you just put it on the side
in the third condition the experimental
got the sheet of paper and directly put
it into a
shredder what happened in those three
conditions in this plot I'm showing you
at what pay rate people stopped so low
numbers means that people worked harder
they worked for much longer in the
acknowledge condition people worked all
the way down to 15 cents at 15 cents per
page they basically stopped this effort
in the shredder condition it was twice
as much 30 cents per sheet and this is
basically the results we had before you
shred people's um effort output you get
them not to be as happy with what
they're doing but I should point by the
way that in the shredder condition
people could have cheated they could
have done not so good work because they
realized that people were just shredding
it so maybe the first sheet you would do
a good work but then you see nobody's
really testing it so you would do more
and more and more so in fact in the
shredder condition people could have
submitted more work and get more money
and put less effort into
it but what about the ignored condition
would the ignored condition be more like
the acknowledge or more like the
shredder or somewhere in the middle it
turns out it was almost like the
shredder now there's good news and bad
news here the bad news is that ignoring
the performance of people is almost as
bad as shredding their effort in front
of their eyes ignoring get you a
wholeway out there the good news is that
by simply looking at something that
somebody has done scanning it and say
ahuh that seems to be quite sufficient
to dramatically improve people's
motivations so the good news is that
adding motivation doesn't seem to be so
difficult the bad news is that
eliminating motivation seem to be
incredibly easy and if we don't think
about it carefully we might overdo it so
this is all in terms of kind of negative
motivation or eliminating negative
motivation the next part I want to show
you something about the positive
motivation so there is a a store in the
US called the AA and AA is a store with
kind of okay furniture that takes a long
time to assemble
and I don't know about you but every
time I assemble one of those it takes me
much longer it's much more effortful
it's much more confusing I put things in
the wrong
way I can't say I enjoy those pieces I
can't say I enjoy the process but when I
finish it I seem to like those AIA
pieces of furniture more than I like
other
ones and there's an old story about cake
mixes so when they started cake mixes in
the ' 40s they would take this powder
and they would put it in a box and they
would ask Housewives to basically pour
it in stir some water in it mix it put
it in the oven and voila you had cake
but it turns out they were very
unpopular people did not want them and
they thought about all kinds of reasons
for that maybe the taste was not good no
The Taste was great what they figured
out was that there was no not enough
effort
involved it was so easy that nobody
could serve cake to their guest and say
here is my cake no no no it was somebody
else's cake it's as if you bought it in
the store it didn't really feel like
your own so what did they do they took
the eggs and the milk out of the
powder now you had to break the eggs and
add them you had to measure the milk and
add it mixing it now it was your cake
now everything was
fine now I think a little bit like the
AIA effect by getting people to work
harder they actually got them to love
what they're doing to a higher degree so
how do we look at this question
experimentally we asked people to build
some origami we gave them instructions
to how to create origami and we gave
them a sheet of paper and these were all
novices
and they built something that was really
quite ugly nothing like a frog or a
crane but then we told them we said look
this orami really belongs to us you
worked for us but I'll tell you what
we'll sell it to you how much do you
want to pay for it and we measured how
much they were willing to pay for it and
we had two types of people we had the
people who build it and we had the
people who did not build it and just
looked at it as external observers and
what we found was that the builders
thought that these were beautiful pieces
of
origami and they were willing to pay for
them five times more than the people who
just evaluated them externally now you
could say if you were a builder do you
think that oh I love this origami but I
know that nobody else would love
it or do you think I love this origami
and everybody else would love it as well
which one of those two is correct turns
out the builders not only loved origami
more they thought that everybody will
see the world in their view they thought
everybody else would love it more as
well in the next version we tried to do
the AA effect we tried to make it more
difficult so for some people we gave the
same task for some people we made it
harder by hiding the instructions at the
top of the sheet we had little diagrams
of how do you fold orami for some people
we just eliminated that so now this was
tougher what happened well in an
objective way the origami now was uglier
it was more difficult now when we looked
at the easy origami we saw the same
thing Builder loved it more evaluators
loved it less when you looked at the
Hard instructions the effect was larger
why because now the builders loved it
even
more they put all this extra effort into
it and
evaluators they loved it even less
because in reality it was even uglier
than the first version
of course this tells you about something
about how we evaluate things now think
about
kids imagine I asked you how much would
you sell your kids
for right your memories and Association
and so on most people would say for a
lot a lot of
money on good
days but imagine this was slightly
different imagine you did not have your
kids and one day you went to the park
and you played you met some kids and
they were just like your kids and you
played with them for a few hours and
when you were about to leave the parents
said hey B by the way just before you
leave if you're interested they're for
sale how much would you pay for them now
most people say not that much no and
this is because our kids are so valuable
not just because of who they are but
because of us because they're so
connected to us and because of the time
and connection and by the way if you
think that ay instructions are not good
think about the instruction that come
with kids those are really
tough by the way these are these are my
kids which of course are wonderful and
and so on which comes to tell you one
more thing which is much like our
Builders when they look at the creature
of their
creation we don't see that other people
don't see things our
way let me say one last
comment if you think about Adam Smith
versus KL Marx Adam Smith had a very
important notion of efficiency he gave
an example of a pin Factory he said pins
have 12 different steps and if one
person does all 12 steps production is
very low but if you get one person to do
step one and one person do step two and
step three and so on production can
increase tremendously and indeed this is
a great example and the reason for the
Industrial Revolution and the efficiency
Carl marks on the other hand said that
the OT ation of Labor is incredibly
important and how people think about the
connection to what they're doing and if
you make all 12 steps you care about the
pin but if you make one step every time
maybe you don't care as
much and I think that in the industrial
revolution Adam Smith was more correct
than KL Marx but the reality that we've
switched and now we're in the knowledge
economy and you can ask yourself what
happens in the knowledge economy is is
efficiency still more important than
meaning I think the answer is no I think
that as we move to situation in which
people have to decide on their own about
how much effort attention caring how
connected they feel to it are they
thinking about Labor on their way to
work and in the shower and so on all of
a sudden Mark has more things to say to
us so when we think about Labor we
usually think about motivation and
payment as the same thing but the
reality is that we should probably add
all kinds of things to it meaning
creation challenge ownership identity
Pride Etc and the good news is that if
we added all of those components and
thought about them how do we create our
own meaning Pride motivation and how do
we do it for in our workplace and for
the employees I think we could get
people to both be more productive and
happier thank you very
[Applause]
