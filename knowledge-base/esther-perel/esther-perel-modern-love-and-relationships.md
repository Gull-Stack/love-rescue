You've just entered my office and
These clips are from the podcast where should we begin?
I'm Esther Perel, and I am a couples therapist
For the past 35 years I've been helping couples and people navigate the challenges of
relationships and
Until not too long ago. There was no such a thing as a couples therapist
Basically you got together with somebody you married, and that was it you were stuck for life
If you didn't like it well you could concern yourself with an early death
It was till death do us apart
Not as we have it today as till love dies
Never before has the survival of the family dependent on the happiness of the couple and
This has made the couple such a central unit
also
The unit of relationships that is probably undergoing the most changes in a very short amount of time
Never have we invested more in love and
never have we divorced or broken up more in the name of love I
Imagine a world in which we can experience
our
relationships with a sense of vitality and aliveness and vibrancy
Because I live with one perennial truth
the quality of your relationships is what determines the quality of your life and
The bonds and the connections that we make with other people that we established with them
Gives us a greater sense of meaning of happiness of well-being than any other
human experience
So let me ask you just for a moment
How many of you are in a relationship at this moment a romantic relationship, let's put it like that
And how many of you would like to be in a relationship
And now I would like some more light on the house for the next question
How many of you would like to be out of the relationship that you're in at least sometimes
You can leave the lights on at this moment
 
So we we can actually really relate to each other to
Do here what we're talking about
Relationships at this moment are undergoing such a massive shift
The norms are literally changing under our feet, and we have to make up the rulebook as we go
You know for a long time
Our relationships were pretty simple because they were dictated by rules
Religion had clear strictures, and it had structure and it had incentives and it had
prohibitions and
Social hierarchy was also very clear and it told us
how parents had to talk to the kids how children had to
Respond to adults her husband's had to talk to their wives and how wives didn't have to answer their husbands
Things were clear
All the decisions were made for us the big decisions
Who was going to be the breadwinner?
Who was going to wake up at night to feed the baby? Who has the right to demand for sex?
What you did is what you father did and at this moment we
have unraveled this system, and we have created a world of options and choices and
unprecedented freedom
But as a result we have to negotiate everything. It's all up for grabs
It's no longer clear who's gonna be the breadwinner in fact whose career is gonna
Take priority at this time who's gonna wake up tomorrow morning to feed the baby
Who's responsible for anything sure initiating sex next time who's going to plan the date?
What gender should I be dating how many people should I be dating at the same time?
Should I tell them about the others?
Am I ready to have children do I even want to have children should I move east should I move West?
Where am I going to go on vacation next
Am I in mind my needs, but getting met in this relationship?
Am I happy am I happy enough?
All these big decisions that have burdened the selfs like never before we have to figure it all out and
because of that
Conversations have become the heart of relationships
We have to talk about stuff that we've never talked about that
We don't know how to talk about that we don't have the vocabulary to talk about and most of the time
We've even never said it to ourselves
Are we up for the right people
So I want to unpack this conundrum with you
and
The way I think is this I'm imagining you sitting there saying so what is she going to tell me?
What are we going to do?
You know and I'm gonna tell you right up front so that you can relax in your anticipation
I do not have three easy steps for what you need to do
And I don't feel bad about it
because as you may have heard I have an accent which means that I'm not from here and
one of the things that non Americans sometimes say is that for some reason Americans think that every problem needs to have a solution and
I don't have a solution because many of these things are not a problem that we have to solve
but these are paradoxes that we need to manage.
For me to understand the confusions and the pains that we are experiencing in our relationships at this point
Demands that I kind of put it in context. How did we get there? What has happened?
What have been the big social and cultural shifts that are directly entering our sheets at this moment?
So allow me to take you on a quick tour in history
For a long time as social animals we lived in tribes. We lived in villages
We lived in communities and in those villages
we were told what to do and things were clear in return for allegiance and for obedience I
Would get a sense of belonging I would get a sense of continuity. I would get a sense of identity I
Got a lot of certainty. I got very little freedom, but I was never alone and
We moved to the cities and in our urban lives
we are for the first time so much more free, but also so much more alone and
For the first time we are turning to our romantic partners
To help us with that aloneness to help us transcend that existential aloneness
We still want all the same things that traditional marriage was about we want family life some of us we want
Companionship we want economic support we want social status
but now I want you also to be my best friend and my
Trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot and all for the long haul and the long haul keeps getting longer
What we have created in a romantic ambition is one person to give us once an entire village used to provide
As I have sometimes said you don't solve this problem with Victoria's Secrets
And since there is no victor secret. We all know where the responsibility has lied
This shift from
The collective life where we had belonging
But very little freedom to where we have a lot of freedom, but everywhere we talk about relationships today
We hear about the fact that we no longer have a deep sense of
anchoring and belonging in rootedness like we used to have and that we are facing a modern massive epidemic of
Loneliness which in America today has become the number one public health crisis
more than obesity
A few other major changes took place in the old model when marriage was primarily an economic Enterprise
Intimacy had to do with sharing the life together you milked the cows you water the land. You'd raise the children
It was about economy
but today when I talk about intimacy I talk about it as into me see and
What I bring to you is not my dowry. It's not my
commercial assets I bring to you my inner life I
Bring to you my wishes my feelings my aspirations my anxieties and when I talk to you
I want you to look at me. No this (typing)
I want contact. I want connection. I want you to make me feel that I matter. I want you to reflect and
validate me and I want to transcend this life of growing atomization.
I also want you to
Help me or to help together actually
Achieve what is probably one of the most amazing
challenges of
Relationships today, this is where we want to bring under one roof
contradictory ideals and contradictory needs on the one hand our need for
security for rootedness for belonging for Anker for predictability for safety and on the other end our
Need for adventure and novelty and change and mystery every living organism
straddles this
polarity between change and stability
every person every relationship every company and
Thriving relationships are the ones who know how to reconcile these two fundamental sets of human needs
If you think for a moment all of you
Have grown up needing both
Security safety and adventure exploration
And some of you may have come of your childhood
needing more protection and
some of you may have come out of your childhood needing more space and autonomy and
If you think about how that enters into your relationships
You will notice that very often
in a couple
there is one person who is more in touch with the fear of losing the other and
One person who is more in touch with the fear of losing themselves
One person more afraid of abandonment and one person more afraid of suffocation
Reconciling security and adventure
reconciling love and desire in one relationship has become one of the great challenges
We today when we look for that person with whom we want to have everything we call that person the soulmate
Have you heard of the soulmate?
How many of you think that you're looking for a soulmate or have found a soulmate or are living with your soulmate?
You know the thing that really interested me about the soulmate is that
It's called the one the one and only all of that
But the soulmate was an interesting concept because for most of history the soulmate meant God
not another human being and
In our secularized society in the West we have basically taken romantic love
to replace the role of religion many times we look to our partners to give us transcendence and
meaning and
ecstasy and wholeness all these things that we used to look for in the perfect world of the divine and
Not only do we bring this zeal for the soulmate?
But the way we are looking for this soulmate is mired in a romantic consumption economy
I am going to look for the one and only
Through that thing where I have a thousand people at my fingertips
What does it mean to look for the one and only in the swiping culture in the village you have two choices?
Later you had six choices
Now you have a thousand choices
Do you know what it means to meet the one?
The one means that this is the one that's going to cure you of your case of FOMO
When I find you I no longer think I could do better
Phenomenal you know
For you my beloved I will delete my apps
Is the new ritual of commitment
And all these decisions by the way, you know that we have to make is it time to delete my apps and we study
Enough at this point. You know
If your parents didn't know any of this, but your grandparents. They would be turning around in their graves
you know
We have very few guidelines and a lot of options and all these options are giving us quite a bit of uncertainty
And quite a bit of self doubt as well
How do I know?
How do I know that I have found the one is a question that people ask me all the time?
When we talk about sex
Which is really an enormous series of changes that have taken place in relationships
First of all there are three primary sexual revolutions the advent of contraception
Without which women could never experience sexuality without women and men could never experience the freedom of
separating sex from reproduction
the women's movement
Which took on the abuses of power and the gay movement which introduced the concept of sexual identity?
For most of history sexuality was seen as a part of our biology
Today we have socialized it it is a part of who we are of our identity of how I see myself of how I
Express myself. It is a sovereign piece of my eye of who I am and for that matter it has become a fundamental human right
We no longer just have sex for reproduction neither is it in long-term relationships or in
Relationships that are with some some length
And it is no longer just a woman's marital duty today
sexuality especially after two kids if you have two or three which is the average Western thing, it's
basically for pleasure and connection no other motive
So it better be good
Because in order to want sex it needs to be sex that is worth wanting
This is really a major shift to have sexuality that is based only on my wanting
Which is the definition of desire is to own the wanting
And hopefully I want you and you want me and it happens to be at the same time
Tell other conditions to fulfill
But we have taken this now
Recently to yet another level a very very important and promising level
Because we are taking on for the first time
Again, maybe not for the first time, but again one of the oldest power dynamics
Related to sex and power
Where men have historically
leveraged their social power
in order to gain access to
sexual favors and
Women have leveraged their youth their beauty their sexuality which often was the only power they had
in order to access
Social power that was otherwise denied to her
This
examination of this power structure is
concurrently under intense scrutiny
And it is also giving us a unique opportunity to finally open up the narrow
boxes in which masculinity femininity
male and female have been locked up for way too long for
The last 40 years
We have done in the West and everywhere else a little bit of the beginning work, but very
significant work to help women
Find their power in their voice
But we have often left men stuck in a complete
definitional void of manhood
Patriarchy doesn't just hurt women
it hurts us all and
To take four year old boys and stop touching them less than we touch our daughters and begin this
Systematic dismantle ment of their emotional lives so that we can make the making of modern
masculinity highly performance-based
rooted in self-reliance and autonomy and
fearlessness and competition
All kinds of things that have actually made men way more vulnerable
Less likely to live long and not always the best partners
If we are going to work towards true equality
We will match our intense efforts in helping women find power and voice
With our intense efforts to help men be able to share their heart and their vulnerability
and in such
We will give people
People human beings the opportunity to be more whole
rather than defined in this very narrow binary gender constructs
so
for that when paradigm changes happen
Things are difficult. It gets messy. It gets confusing there are misunderstandings
There are judgments and more than ever we need
conversation and we need nuanced
conversations and
As it happens often we therapists get to hear these conversations in our offices
But we don't get to share them with the world
because generally, this is a room of which nobody ever enters except the people themselves the couple and
So with the podcast I wanted to create a space
Where you can hear the conversations that maybe you will want to have at some point?
People who talk about things that they've never said to each other and rarely to themselves you see fake news isn't just for politics
It also applies
acutely to the purity of instagram lives
where we craft and filter these perfect fictitious stories and
Nobody really knows what truly goes on in the lives of other couples
and
everybody comes into my office and
You may be asking yourselves am I the only one that experiences this
And I am here to tell you
No, you're not
In fact it is set up in such a way that when we deal with
imperfections with pains with longings with yearnings with frustrations
Instead of knowing that they are part of a collective yearning or a social ill we privatize the problem
And we make it our own
The podcast was a way to recreate a virtual village
Where you we get to know what goes on in the lives of others?
You know the village you could hear every fight and every fuck
The walls were porous it was simple
but
Now you have friends they come to tell you that they're breaking up, and you didn't see it coming
Miscarriages, and you didn't know about them affairs, and you certainly didn't know about them
It's like nobody knows. What is really going on in the lives of another couple and that isolation
That loneliness doesn't help us. It's actually quite damaging
So I want you to look under your seat every one of you you will find a blindfold I
Ask that you put the blindfolds on
So you can put everything else down and put on the blindfold
Please don't cheat
Because we are going to listen together
You see when you
Limit one sense like sight it often
Activates the other senses and the first one that it activates is actually listening
listening is the first sense that any
baby
Experiences in utero it is the recognition of the mother's voice it is our first most primal connective sense
When we listen deeply to other people we reach into their humanity we also get to see
Ourselves, and we certainly get to understand otherness
difference
Let's listen together
Intensely, and if you get uncomfortable if you feel the vulnerability of having your sight limited just breathe
and
Accept it notice it
The couple I want you to listen to to meet they have been together for about ten years
They've just gone through a major crisis. They have two children
They are wondering when Trust is broken
Can it be brought back
They are in the midst of this conversation for the first time understanding that the legacies
That they bring are not only the ones of their families
But also the large also scripts that they so beautifully internalized both of them
clip number two
Can we play?
I had a very hard time shedding that person who was invulnerable
Who can take on everything
Who can trust
You know grin and bear it
Did your father hit you?  -yes?
Yes, i was abused.
And is that where you learn to grin and bear and say I will never show you that you hurt me?
Yes
It drove me
That's what it did I said, I'll show you I'll show you I'll show you I'll show you what?
that no one can hurt me I
Never show of vulnurability again because vulnerable people get stepped on and I don't want to be a victim anymore
She's ever seen you like this not until recently very few times. I would say
It was new to me. How real that pain is for you?
What am I?
Early thirties I was like eight nine years old and you know I was saying my minute can Republic and we were playing basketball
Got a little heated
You didn't really want to fight, but you had to show that you're tough and that like yeah
I I want to fight be really in your back you mind. I really don't want to fight. You're really hoping that
Some adults will come and say now now boys you know
It wasn't my case
My case it was come here. Go kick his ass, and I'm gonna put bets on
So picture this two eight nine year old boys
Going at each other in a circle and the adults
were
saying "come on, go, go, go kick his ass. Now punch him in the face."
That's the kind of environment
That's the kind did you get beat up? Yeah? I don't ask you
Go bad never told my parents at all I was ever thought because your dad said if you get your butt kicked
If you get your hands come home. Oh, okay, I rise on top of that
But it also makes me appreciate
so much, how you
Didn't teach your boys this no and you
together
You let your boys cry
Right we in our parenting, but a lot of that I got from you
you helped me a lot I
Always said you were but all because Union yeah, we're a very aggressive very
But a lot of our our
family and friends and just social circles a
lot of people have that mindset of
The reason I turned out the way, I did and the reason I'm such an upstanding
Good human being is because I've got my butt kicked when I was a kid and look at kids today. They have no respect
You can take off the blindfolds, and if you want you can keep them for tonight
So it blows my mind that I get to hear these conversations and nobody else does
Because I know
That when we listen
deeply to
The experiences of other people we often actually find ourselves standing in front of our own mirror
and we can see ourselves and
We can also get inspiration for the courageous conversations that we need to be having
So, what did you hear just take a moment where did it take you?
And just notice it I
Want you to reflect for a moment on some of these questions
How do you show up in your relationships and
How often do you avoid showing up with emojis
What are some of the things that you do to disconnect from others
When's the last time that you read a book or
Who did a workshop or for that matter came to a talk like this one?
In order to learn to become a better partner or a better lover
Is there someone that
You would need to call at this moment
To whom you owe some apology?
Or to whom you simply are checking in. How are you?
We are at survey and you are all creatives and innovators
many of you are part of the architecture that is aiming to redesign just about every part of our lives, but
Recently when I went to one of these big tech conferences they did a series of moonshots
the future of food the future of fashion the future of transportation of Education of cybersecurity
You name it 10
None of them on the future of relationships
How can that be it's almost irresponsible?
Especially when we know that the quality of our relationships is what determines
the quality of our lives I
Want you to bring relationships to the heart of your
Occupations and preoccupations to bring it back to have its centrality
Acknowledged so that loneliness isn't just something that hides in plain sight
And in this week that you are here
When you see somebody standing alone talk to strangers
Touch them ask them look at them just check in with them
And if you're here because somebody made it possible for you to be here
We eat from work or from home
Call them
Call them and thank them for making it possible for you to be here because they're Manning the home front of the front whichever
Don't just say. I'm sorry
For not being there because if you're sorry for not being there. It's more about how important you are
You get that
But if you actually say, thank you and you show appreciation
For what they do that allows you to do what you do
Then you enter into the fundamental understanding that relationships are complex systems that are made up of
interdependent parts
You can be here because somebody is there
and
In the course of this week
Maybe one time instead of sending a text
Call and
maybe one time when you go, and you have a meal with somebody you leave your phone in your pocket and
Don't just walk with it to the bathroom
To do all the things now you get what I'm saying
Relationships people they are your story
Write well and edit often. Thank you
So
This is only part one
Can we get some light in the house and?
Let's talk together
so
Let's talk ask questions
When your question is no longer a question I will tell you
But I think that this is just the beginning of a tableau just itching of the landscape and now we can begin to
cook
So they are mixing the aisles
You're going to need to get up and come to the mics so that
We can all hear you and just let's go
Yes
Where are you?
Yeah, right in the middle it's okay. I will see you there. I know yes
So I was recently in a conversation with my friends, and I work in a corporation and a lot of feminists
Etc etc and we had a conversation about men missing from the conversation
And I heard them say we need to stop talking about men. You know. It's we need to focus on women right now
It's just a cop-out and I love your talk about how do we bring men into this conversation in relationship?
So what would be your advice when you're having those conversations in you you hear a lot of?
What I would say is this it's one line
And it's not a line that is new for me
I've been saying it for quite a while the lives of women will not change until
the men come along
The lives of women will not change until the men get the opportunity to also examine and define and change their lives
in many ways I
Sometimes think that the 20th century was the century where the women made all these massive
Changes and the 21st century will be the changes of that man will make
partly in adapt to the changes that the women have done I
Don't think that you get to be safe by excluding
You need moments when you are alone, but you need plenty of new conversations
nuanced conversations
uncomfortable conversations that tolerate ambiguity and deal with the profound ambivalence that some of us have
Over the status quo. Thank you so much
Yes
Hey Esther, thanks for being here today. I think you're such a rockstar you would tell this to my mother. She's
Nothing like you
I actually have a personal question. I was wondering if in one
Of your relative roles as a mother or a wife or a woman or whichever you have ever
Suffered from shall I say loss of identity
No a beautiful question. Yes continue your sentence. Sorry if so, then how have you dealt with it? Yeah?
I
Think that this question that you asked is actually one of the fundamental challenges
in relationship
How do you maintain connection and?
separateness at the same time
How do you experience togetherNess and individuality at the same time? How do you stay connected to yourself?
You need your sensations your body your pleasure your whatever. It is and at the same time are close to somebody else
Whenever I this is totally personal I in 35 years with Jack with the same partner
I have two sons 21 and 24 and when I felt like that sentence
that would come up in me was I'm not made for this I
Would literally leave for a week
Thank you so much. I thought was very good
It made it very clear that I'm not merely so needed and that important and everybody seems to do quite well when I'm not around
So that is very good for the grandiosity
And then the second part was I went to meet people friends that gave me back
They are the parts of myself that were not the ones that live at home
We need community we need our relationships to exist within a larger social
context that has been always very very clear to me and
The nice thing is that generally I think I've never worried otherwise my husband would say to me. Have a great time
so he was not unhappy about it I
Howdy I really loved your insight into how there are all these different dynamics
that are sub layering on how everything now is the negotiation and a conversation and
Just this past week with my own therapist we talked about how she actually really likes ultimatums as a way to
Move things forward yes
Negotiation so I'd love your perspective
You have an ultimatum that you need to put on somebody who is not making a decision that you would like him or her to
make maybe
I
Will use this hypothetically
He is here
So that changes the whole thing, I just went from an individual session to a couple session
The ultimatum is not to the other person
The ultimatum is it's not even an ultimatum. You need to know what you can live with how much uncertainty how much
You know there's a term. I sometimes used to describe what happens in relationships these days. It's called stable ambiguity
Stable ambiguity is that we are together?
Just enough so that I don't have to feel alone, but not too much so that I don't have to feel committed
Any of you know what I'm talking about
You need to know how much of that stable ambiguity
You know too afraid to be alone not mature enough to really delve deep and it's for you. You don't say to the other person
April March the summer Christmas my exam my promotion
You know all these ultimatums
You just simply at one point you decide I don't want this this this the and I don't want it for a multitude of reasons
It makes me you know it makes me doubt myself
It makes me doubt your connection to me. I would like this project to start and
You decide you don't put yourself in a position where you make the other person decide and you wait
Helplessly till they let you know what they want, which they don't know what they want
Hello, sir hi. Hello, ma'am I'm a huge fan of yours. I've watched both your TED Talks multiple times question. Yes, I do
I mean I like to hear it. You know it's a waste of time. I can tell you more about anyone
So the first I guess one. I guess two questions, so one is now you get one one question
There's a long line behind you okay, lovely so this is the question it's a hard one, but we're gonna go there
So I'm black as you can tell and I've noticed within especially black Millennials a lot of my white friends in college a lot of
Them are mostly getting married my black friend to see they're not happening or it's happening later
And I don't know if this is something you've studied or if you read any literature on it
But I think that our history as a community in this country
affects my generations ability to get out of that stable and the beauty that you talk about
So I don't know if there's resources things you've read about that or just
General tips for how people in my generation to get away from that stable
Ambiguity and to move forward and to get rid of whatever fears or things are great. What a beautiful question. Thank you first of all
So I
Think that one of the things that needs to happen is you having this conversation first of all with multiple other men
Of all colors for that matter, but maybe first with your own and your own is a broad group
You know your own is just a buffer. That's a whole other conversation, but
You know I think you know what I'm saying so that's the first thing is that?
What you will realize is that it's not you know is there something wrong with me that I want to be doing this everybody else
seems to be perfectly content with that and you know and
There I won't tell you know there into the optimization and I would like something else
That's the first thing the second thing is you open the conversation?
This is where you use the tools and you say you know in our community
We have an issue
This in our community you have an issue
We are not meeting
Many of the women of color do not go to with men of color
We have discrepancies of education and this and that we have a long list of what black men should represent
And it is not what I want to be and body else out there, and you make this become something that is
echoed
communion and from that place
I think at some point you will realize
My experience in Italy when somebody wants something else is that there are plenty of other people who want that same thing?
But they don't know each other
You know sometimes in my office
I think I should take this one and mix them with that when I do this
you know I feel like I'm dying to change my practice into a
dating service on occasion
You know because I've sat with men that tell me that story, and I'm thinking but this one you know
I wish they maybe I can schedule them at the same time so they can live in the waiting room. You know something like that
But I think the first thing you do with something like this is you take it out of its hidden
secret
Shameful unacknowledged place you normalize it because what you want is a beautiful thing
And it shouldn't have to be the exception
Oh, we have good 11 minutes people have never had so much fat
You talked a lot about loneliness
And how people aren't really don't know what's going on in other couples mm-hmm. Do you agree?
Yeah, and I also feel like there's also this issue with
Community like what community because like I come have community people that I was with before I met my girlfriend
She has her community of people and so I wonder what your thoughts are on how a couple really should really start
Establishing a community and finding people who you can connect with and how whether that should be coming from the groups that the individuals have
Whether you should still
So you know one thing that you will notice if you put in Google friendships between men and women and the American Google is
That the first whatever 30 articles all tell you it's impossible
This is weird just so you know this is not true
This is a cultural script. You know. This is a cultural script in a society
Where sex is always deeply uncomfortable and where as a culture we are at the same time completely obsessed and embarrassed by it?
So that's why there is this notion that you can't be because they may be an attraction, and if there is an attraction
What are you going to do with it? You know you could lose it as if people can't just you know
but that
keep their hands in I
Think that you have friends that come with you each of you bring people
colleagues
mentors
Other people that you meet at events like this that are not in your inner circle
But they are acquaintances with whom you share certain things
You want a village a big village actually you want friends that are together and friends that you have alone?
Because the friends that you have alone often help you be together
You know I call my bitch about my partner, and then they say yeah mine too, and then I think where am I going?
It's just as bad there
You know marriage is marriage. It's like you know all
Right think the other part. That's it shit. I have it actually so good
You know he lets me be you know for the life of me
I couldn't have somebody who wants so many things and criticizes me all the time. I loved it space
It's like you need to step outside of your own narrow dyadic frame to get perspective and with that perspective
Comes the things you want to change and the things you want to keep and I can't emphasize it enough
You know in this country
This is just one example. I had of this and then we could do an entire top on it when people need help
Especially when it's a family stuff. You know first. They look for an option to pay
Then if really they can't find someone then they may go and ask a friend with utter reluctance that it would impose on them
Who doesn't like to be helpful?
Who doesn't feel more connected and more important in the lives of others because other people need you this is warped
so for that
Connection to take place and all the other community thing. It's about really acknowledging that we are profoundly
Interdependent people nobody goes at it alone, and if they do they don't do it well
Hi
Can you lower the mic a tiny bit to you some yeah
What is your opinion about and resolve the childhood trauma our relationships?
What is my opinion about unresolved trauma in childhood
I'm gonna answer you
Differently because otherwise I'd need to know more about it in order to make an answer that says something
But I will answer you more personally
Because I am a child of Holocaust survivors
So I had to leave know the question that you're talking about
My two parents were both in concentration camps for five years each
And they both were the only people that survived from their entire family
so I would kind of say that trauma came with mother's milk and
literally I kind of it absorbed it with osmosis and
Then many other things and the thing that I want you to understand is that every time you think
PTSD you also have to think post-traumatic growth
We are resilient people
We we know to suffer and we know to
Sometimes take that very suffering and turn it into our resources and into our strengths
But sometimes when people had experienced massive trauma they can land in two places
some people didn't die and
Some people come back to life
some people end up surviving and some people just
manage also to thrive and
what I hope for you is whatever you experience that you can take that life force that is in you and
give yourself the permission to both cry and yearn and mourn and all of that on whatever it is that happened and
Give yourself the permission to experience full joy and connection. Thank you
Yes, hi I'm part of a group that designs for long distance relationships
And so the core question we have is how do we create and maintain?
intimacy and support
When you can't physically be what's all right great
I've done a bunch of articles about this
Actually, you know I think that one of the things that is very interesting is to really understand the difference between
Intimacy and surveillance
Do you know what I'm saying you seem to know
as
In where were you today? What did you do? Where did you eat?
Did you finish your meal was it good was it well cooked you know it's like
Who cares and what does it tell us you know I think in a very interesting way
That you want to use the distance one of the beautiful things is that we know that?
Desire is rooted in absence and in longing as well as it is in heaving
So I think that the way you work on the distance is you you instead of trying to minimize it you actually
Completely make it front and center, and you want you connect every few days
But when you do you do it meaningfully you write you write letters the first time is nice and the sky
But there is something about writing letters that is by the way
Apropos the previous question when you write a letter you are at the same time with yourself and with the other person
We've lost that you know it's very different from a text
It's also nice texting
but there is something about going internally and
Inviting the other person to accompany you there for a while that is much more interesting than how is management ink doing
Thank you. I
Mean do you have questions that I could answer?
Every one of them for we built an hour talk, but yes
hi, I have a question um I'm in graduate school, and I'm graduating in May to become a therapist and
the entire curriculum, no one has ever talked about sex therapy and I
really love to hear your perspective on monogamy and long-term relationships when infidelity is so common and
Having those that paradox of wanting adventure and
wanting stability and
basically how you heandle that
Just wrote a whole book about this. It's called the state of affairs
And it really you know it looks at the number of things around monogamy
you know the interesting thing about monogamy by the way is that monogamy used to be one person for life and
To do today monogamy is one person at a time
So people tell me very often. You know I am monogamous in all my relationships
Plural it makes perfect
sense you know monogamy had nothing to do with love it was basically an economic imposition on women and
Today it has everything to do with love and people used to cheat because relationships marriages were not meant to provide
passion and love and today people cheat sometimes because the marriage or the relationship
They're in doesn't give them the love and the passion that they wanted or that it promised
so
I
Think that as a whole I would simply say this
Infidelity has always existed it has existence since marriage was invented
It's very complex, and we can't reduce these
multi-layered human experiences into good and bad
victim and perpetrators and black and white and
Anything I will do in working about relationships all of your relationships
Is to help bring back?
complexity nuance and less judgment and more reflection
So the rest you will find in the book
But also by the way the podcast has quite a few episodes on that and I don't know if I mentioned it
But today Friday March 9 is when season 2 goes on iTunes
Thank you
For all of you to enjoy
Yes, hi
So do you believe that every human being has the same capacity for emotion?
Do we all feel with the same potential or do we all have different minimums and maximums?
The latter the latter we are latter we we all have the same we all pretty much share the six basic emotions
But the way we experience them the way we narrate them and the room we make for them is very diverse
People I am very very sorry I see that the doors have opened and
So I have literally a few seconds to say sorry for the questions
I will not answer, and thank you for all of you for being here
I'm here for two more talks one with bumble and one with Vox and one with redo
so if you want to hear more we can continue to be in conversation and
Where should we begin?
