so most of us think that fighting is bad
for romantic relationships right how
many people do you know who say hey I
had a great fight the other day oh yeah
my partner and I fight all the time and
we're super
happy 52 years ago we put love under the
microscope Julie and I are the founders
of the Gutman Institute and the love lab
and we've made the study of
relationships our life's work and our
research tells us that fighting is good
for relationships not bad in our
lab we saw that almost all couples fight
in fact how they fight in the first
three minutes predicts with
96% accuracy not only how the rest of
the conversation will go but how the
rest of the relationship will go six
years down the
road my God I know it's terrifying isn't
it so it's not if we fight that
determines relationship success it's how
we fight in fact our research has
revealed that some fighting actually
increases connection it even improves
our sex life so how do we fight right
early on John and his colleague Robert
levenson in their lab simply watched
couples interacting sounds simple but
nobody had ever done that before over
time 3,000 couples came to the lab as
they were being videotaped they wore
monitors that measured such things as
respiration heart rate and stress
hormones and then they had a conflict
discussion and they talked about the
events of their day afterward words they
rated how they felt during each
conversation before returning
home they would return to the lab every
year or two and repeat the same
procedure and some were followed for as
long as 20
years videotapes were synchronized to
the physiological data and then in a
split screen video second by second we
measured the couple's work words
emotions facial expressions and
Physiology year after year over time we
saw that some couples separated or
divorced some remained together
unhappily While others stayed together
happily what made the difference between
the couples who were successful and the
couples who were
unsuccessful or as we call them the
Masters and the disasters
the couples in our studies were all ages
sexual orientations and ethnically
diverse after a
while just by watching a couple we could
predict what would happen with over 90%
accuracy what would happen in their
relationship 6 years later which meant
we never got invited to dinner
anymore we found that there were three
major styles of fighting conflict
avoiders who just agreed to disagree and
would rather wash the dishes than argue
a point I'm a conflict the
voider he is Believe
Me conflict validators would bring up an
issue by expressing their feelings
calmly and then jumping immediately into
problem solving so think of your most
patient kindergarten
teacher then there were the conflict
volatiles they would Express their
feelings intensely and very
passionately notice I
say just fine not
bad and then they would leap into trying
to prove that they were right and their
Partners were wrong okay so think of a
very expressive basketball coach on the
sidelines or me I'm a
volatile well and some Partners had
different styles of fighting from one
another but the good news that we
discovered that whether you have those
three styles of fighting or you're
mismatched you can have a successful
relationship as long as the ratio of
positive to negative responses during
the conflict discussion it was at least
5 to one and examples of positive
responses were head nods affection
interest shared humor and words like
fair
enough okay so what about the negatives
were all the negatives equally negative
no there were four big predictors of
relationship demise that we called The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
all right the first one was criticism
and criticism means blaming a problem on
a personality flaw of your partner for
example if you walked into a messy
kitchen and you wanted to be critical
you would say oh my God this place is
such a mess why are you such a
slob how do you answer that the second
horse is contempt contempt is like
criticism but it has a dash of
superiority so with contempt you include
scorn disgust sarcasm and nasty insults
like you're such a loser why did I ever
marry you the third Horseman is
defensiveness that's the most common one
and that's when we act like an innocent
victim I did too pay the bills or we
Counterattack oh yeah well you didn't
pay the bills on
time the fourth Horseman is stonewalling
when we shut down completely and we
don't even give the speaker any signs
that we're listening and stonewalling we
really wall ourselves off from our
[Music]
partner the
fourth is a bad one but here's another
one that may be related to it it's
called flooding or fight flight or
freeze so a partner in the middle of a
conversation may be sitting there and
looking totally calm on the outside but
inside their heart rates are rocketing
up above 100 beats a minute they feel
like they're being attacked by a
tiger but it's only our partner and when
we're flooded we can't think straight we
can't listen very well and we certainly
can't creatively problem
solve if you get flooded here's what's
crucial you stop immediately and call
for a
break then say when you'll come back to
continue the conversation that's really
important and during the break do not
think about the fight
instead Simply Self soothe and then come
back at the designated time when you're
physiologically calm you look like a
totally different person and it's much
easier to be reasonable and to listen
well now what do couples do who fight
right versus fight
wrong the couples who are really
struggling and distressed may bring up
an issue in that first three minutes of
the
conversation with something we call
harsh startup which almost always
includes criticism or contempt the
couples who fight right will bring up
the issue with what we call softened
startup so what's soften startup suffen
startup consists of a bunch of ey
statements that describe you and not
your partner at all you start with what
you feel then you describe the situation
at hand and then what you do need from
your partner to make things better
rather than what you resent and here's
an example of harsh versus soften
startup all right so let's say you've
been cooking dinner every single night
for the last year now you're a little
tired of it all right so what would a
harsh startup sound like you're just too
cheap to take me out to
dinner look all right a soften startup
would sound more like
this I'm feeling frustrated there's your
feeling about needing to cook dinner
every night that's the situation here
all the
eyes would you please take me out to
dinner tonight
that's your positive need at a workshop
with 12200 people we posed that question
to the audience and asked them to come
up with a soften startup for that
situation and one guy raised his hand
and he was competent but very succinct
he said I'm feeling hungry I'm going out
to dinner would you like to come
along later on we gave an example about
sex the entire audience went silent and
very shy except for this same guy so I
had to call on him right so he went over
the top a little bit and this is what he
said for a softened startup honey I'm
feeling horny I'm going to go upstairs
and have sex would you like to come
along
one finding that really shocked us in
our research was this
69% of all relationship conflict
problems are Perpetual which means that
they never go away they never get fully
solved and so we learn that conflict
really mostly needs to be managed rather
than
solved in our lab the couples who came
back year after year kept bringing up
exactly the same issue even 20 years
later right so when we think about
fighting right whether talking about a
Perpetual problem or a solvable problem
what is the biggest mistake that the
disasters of relationships make the
answer is that they fight to win which
means somebody has to
lose what do the Masters do instead they
fight to understand fighting to
understand means taking a conversation
about an issue and going much deeper to
understand what's beneath your partner's
position on the issue that builds the
connection at the core of fighting to
understand is asking one another a set
of predesigned questions that are
designed to get at people's thoughts and
feelings behind their position on the
issue they don't interrupt and then they
trade roles now we call this the dreams
within conflict conversation because it
really helps people get at their
thoughts and feelings behind their
position without feeling judged or
attacked there are six questions in all
and these questions unearth each
person's values
feelings background history and ideal
dream regarding the
issue I'm going to give you an
illustration using just two out of the
six questions so there was a couple who
were really fighting over whether or not
to get a dog
okay there was a woman who we will call
Jenny who was adamantly opposed to
getting a dog but her partner a woman
who we will call Alice
was all for it so they decided to try
the dreams within conflict
conversation so when Allison asked Jenny
do you have some background or childhood
history that's part of your position on
this issue she said absolutely when I
was a kid I got chased and bitten by
just about every dog in our neighborhood
wow but the real understanding came with
the dream question so what is your ideal
dream here regarding this issue you know
if we don't have a dog we're not tied
down we're not burdened we're free to
travel the world together and have
adventures together that's what I really
want now listen to what Allison said
when she was asked about the childhood
history question she said you know when
I was a kid I was all alone okay so my
golden retriever was my best friend he
really kept me from feeling totally
alone and to the dreams question she
said H you know I see getting a dog as a
practice run for having kids and having
a family I know that dogs and kids are a
lot of
responsibility but they both bring so
much love with them into the family
that's what I want so on the surface
this fight was about whether or not to
get a dog but beneath the surface it was
about leading a life of adventure and
travel versus staying home and raising a
family without the dreams within
conflict conversation they never would
have gotten to this level of
understanding of one
another in an unpublished study we found
that
87% of sick 600 couples many of whom
were distressed made major breakthroughs
on Gridlock conflicts using tools like
this so now if we look around our
world we see a world that is caught in
win lose battles that are so
polarized
so the same thing we're seeing in our
couples who are also Locked In Win Lose
standoffs we've never seen such Furious
uncompromising fighting before it's
enough to fill you full of
Despair but our research has taught us
that there are science-based tools that
can gentle down a conflict scrape the
escalations off the ceiling and lead
people to m Mutual understanding of one
another's positions ending this win-
lose mentality and leading a couple to a
compromise that honors both people's
dreams you all know that
relationships are the foundations of our
communities our society and our world if
we can all work on learning how to fight
right even at home
there is hope we can build a more loving
and peaceful world one couple at a time
thank you thank you
