you're so
selfish what an idiot it's not my fault
we're always
late forget
it criticism contempt defensiveness and
stonewalling Dr John godman calls these
negative communication patterns The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse because
they'll lead to the end of your
relationship in fact he can predict this
relationship failure with over 90%
accuracy if the behavior isn't changed
so what can you do well at the Gman
Institute we understand you might not
even know you're communicating this way
or you might not know how to control it
but if you practice the following four
research-based antidotes there is hope
for your
future criticism attacks the character
of the recipient instead of focusing on
a specific behavior the antidote to
criticism is to talk about your feelings
using eye statements then Express a
positive
need contempt is an expression of
superiority that comes out as sarcasm
cynicism name calling eye rolling
sneering mockery and hostile humor
contempt is the greatest predictor of
relationship failure and must be
eliminated the antidote to contempt is
to treat one another with respect and
build a culture of appreciation within
the
relationship defensiveness is self-
protection through righteous indignation
or playing the victim defensiveness
never solves the problem and is really
just an underhanded way of blaming your
partner the antidote to defense
is to accept responsibility even if only
for part of the
conflict stonewalling occurs when the
listener withdraws from the conversation

conversation spare your relationship
