what was Venice Beach before so this has
been what I've dedicated my life to
there are 900,000 divorces in the United
States of America every year fewer than
10% of them ever talked to anybody about
their relationship so why would you need
a science well we need a science to
develop effective treatment and
understanding of how to make love work
why why should we care about having
great relationships well it turns out
that in the past 50 years a field called
social epidemiology has emerged and it
shows that great friendships great love
relationships between lovers and parents
and children lead to greater health
mental health as well as physical health
greater wealth greater resilience faster
recovery from illness greater longevity
if you want to live 10 to 15 years
longer work on your relationships not
just your exercise and more successful
children as well so love has a kind of
magic it's able to do amazing things and
one of my favorite films is Sleepless in
Seattle with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and
I just want to share with you a quote
where Tom Hanks is on the radio with the
talk show host Marcia and she says to
him Sam tell me what was so special
about your wife and Tom Hanks says sam
says well how long is your program oh
well it was a million tiny little things
we were supposed to be together and I
knew it I knew it the very first time I
touched her it was like coming home only
to no home I'd ever known it was just
taking her hand to help her out of the
car and you know it was
like magic and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
say the word magic at the same time so
what about this magic can science really
help find the magic of love well the
first step is that we needed a lot of
data we needed to basically understand
relationships better and that's not
something I did alone in fact 45 years
ago we built a love lab and this lab was
built in part by a bromance my desk
friend Bob Levinson and I created this
lab and Bob and I became good friends
and we realized that our relationships
with women were not going very well it
went from one disaster to another so
basically two clueless guys got together
to build this laboratory and then over
30 years ago our romance with my wife
dr. Julie Schwartz Cartman and we
decided to work together to see whether
we could make a difference so basic
research was followed by Applied
Research now we use validated
questionnaires online questionnaires
that allow us to assess the strengths of
the relationship in the areas that need
improvement and we validated these
questionnaires to make sure that we knew
what we measuring and we could measure
things reliably and accurately so we
created this checkup and over 40,000
couples have taken these questionnaires
and we get a green circle for a strength
a red box for an area that needs
improvement but we get their story of
their relationship we ask them about how
they met we find out the quality of
their friendship and intimacy from this
interview and we collect physiological
measures from them as they're talking to
one another
we're measuring heart rate blood
velocity skin conductance respiration a
variety of things like that and we score
data motion second by second and this
kind of split screen arrangement where
even though they're facing each other we
can really code facial expressions voice
tone nonverbal behavior and verbal
behavior very accurately and reliably we
have them use a video recall rating dial
which they just turned from extremely
negative to extremely positive as
they're watching the videotapes to get
their perception of the interaction as
well and then we synchronize all of that
video physiology coded emotion and
perception and on the left you see all
the physiological measures were
collecting and you know a cursor that
moves along in this particular moment
you know the wife is says something that
just makes the husband dissolve in
hilarity and shared humor turns out to
be very powerful in a relationship at
reducing physiological arousal so what
do we find from this laboratory we got
over 90 percent success in predicting
either divorce of stability or the
happiness of relationships that were
stable and the major impact of that
finding was that truly and I didn't get
invited out to dinner very often but the
effects replicated six different times
in six studies that Bob Levitz and I did
over the whole life course and that's
probably the most replicated effect in
the study of relationships now and we're
no longer alone other labs of getting
very similar kinds of results we
followed these couples for as long as 20
years straight couples gay and lesbian
couples newlyweds middle-aged couples
older couples into their late 80s and
90s so what do we find this over 90
percent prediction what predicts and we
kind of sit down in our lab and talk to
a couple about their strengths and areas
of needed improvement based upon this
research well one thing we do is we
create kind of a Dow Jones Industrial
Average of a conversation and by doing
that very much like the Dow Jones it's
really good if the cumulative positive
minus negative emotions are going up in
other words on the Left we see a
low-risk couple where you know there
really is much more positive than
negative in general right they go up and
down and on the right the high-risk
couple where basically they go down all
along their interaction well it turns
out that one thing we discovered was
that the
the conversation starts in the first
three minutes of a conflict discussion
will predict 96% of the time whether
there are low-risk couple or high-risk
couple so start up the way each person
starts before they start influencing one
another is very critical in this
prediction the other thing we learned is
something we call the roach hotel model
of relationships
remember the ropes hotel the roaches
check in but they don't check out that's
a really good roach trap
well negative emotions anger sadness
disappointment fear all these emotions
this the negative emotions for unhappy
couples become like that roach hotel
once they check in they don't check out
it's hard to exit and easy to enter this
negative effects state and it turned out
the balance of positive and negative
emotions is our key index of this magic
that Tom Hanks was talking about in
Sleepless in Seattle
the balance of positive and negative
emotions so this ratio of positivity to
negativity during conflict in unhappy
couples that's why this slide is in red
was point eight to one just a little bit
more negativity than positivity and I
was completely wrong I thought that
would be a great relationship you know
in my relationships you know that it
failed we were much more negative than
positive so I thought if it was balanced
it would be great but no it turned out
that actually the balance of positive
and negative emotions are in conflict in
relationships that were stable and happy
was five to one there was five times as
much affection humor interest in one
another excitement connection then there
was hostility disappointment anger
negativity so there really was a balance
that was way balanced toward positive
emotions in happy stable relationships
so this five to one positive to negative
ratio has become pretty widely known I
left the Starbucks in Seattle recently
and the guy drove by in his pickup truck
and he rolled down the window and he
said hey five to one right
I said right so we both gave us the
thumbs up side so that's our index of
the magic but then we thought okay you
have an index but how do you change that
index what do you need to really make a
difference and so our hypothesis was the
in needed three things physiological
calm and Trust and commitment
so what about those things can we
actually measure those in our laboratory
and can we actually make a difference
and this is right
well the first one physiological calm
was kind of a balance in physiology the
couples whose heart rates were lower
whose blood was flowing less rapidly who
weren't sweating as much those people
actually seemed kind of boring but they
had great relationships they were gentle
with one another non-hostile they
reassured one another very interesting
balance in Physiology created by their
behavior and by the way we found we have
to measure these things so I have a
pulse oximeter right here and it allows
me when I put press the button to really
find out what my heart rate is and what
the percent oxygen is and right now my
heart rate is 110 beats a minute and my
percent oxygen is 92 percent so that
sucks I'm highly aroused ideologically
so you can't tell what's going on
physiologically with somebody by looking
at them you have to actually measure it
and we have to build physiological calm
in a couple now why why is that so
important well it turns out that when
people are calm they can take in
information they can listen they can be
empathetic they have access to their
sense of humor that's very important but
when they're flooded when there's a
diffuse activation of various parts of
the autonomic nervous system they're
much more likely to be an attack or
defend log right so if a therapist
doesn't know what's going on
physiologically and says can you
summarize what your wife just said
summarize what your husband just says
can you validate and be empathetic
they
and do it if they're physiologically
aroused right so the therapist actually
has to know that to help them calm down
so physiological calm is good that's
what we learned so part of that trio of
variables we know we have validation
that that's important but the magic also
comes we hypothesized from building
trust
so what's trust it's something that
people talk about but can you measure it
and it turns out we can measure it
reliably and validly and a trusting
relationship a mutually trusting
relationship really these the intimacy
and great sex a distrusting relationship
leads to loneliness and guess what
the major reason people have affairs is
not because of sex or desire it's
because they're lonely and they have
found somebody who finds some
interesting and wants to talk to them in
the context of a relationship that
really isn't working very well so what
is trust how do we define it how do we
measure it and here we use mathematics
the mathematics of game theory and we
can actually measure this idea that
mutual trust comes when from when both
partners are maximizing the benefits of
both people not just one person's
benefit against the other person so I'm
always thinking about how does my wife
see things I can walk into a kitchen now
if they're 30 years of marriage and view
that kitchen the way my wife would do it
so I can say Julie would be able to be
upset by that so I'll clean it up and
well now I know when she comes in she's
not going to notice anything that's
really disgusting you know I'm more of a
slob so you know for me it was fine you
know but you know people who develop
neutral trustor really always have their
partners in their heads not just
themselves and they're thinking about
both both of them but the magic also
comes from building commitment so what
does this mean well we've learned a lot
about commitment from the systematic
research of a woman named Carol Russ
bolt and another woman named Shirley
and what we've learned is that in
relationships there is a turning point a
key turning point when things aren't
going well when your partner is hostile
or irritable or emotionally distant if
you really in your own head or
cherishing your partner and nurturing
gratitude for what you have and saying
this is my journey Julie is the love of
my life and I'm damn lucky to have this
person in my life that turning point
leads to loyalty on the other hand
betrayal comes from really at that point
when things aren't going well making
negative comparisons between your
partner and real or imagined
alternatives betrayal leads to
dissolution very reliably whereas
commitment leads to loyalty and then
when you have that sense of commitment
in a relationship both of you have that
you really have a safe place you have
that magic and with over 90 percent
prediction with these basic variables
the mechanism by which relationships
work trust physiological calm and
commitment can we actually create a
mathematics of love now why would you
want to create mathematics and love why
do you want to put math and love
together some people think that's really
disgusting well if you can create a
mathematics you really will understand
not just a static nature of commitment
trust and physiological calm affecting a
relationship and creating the magic you
actually will understand the dynamics of
the interaction as it unfolds over time
and that's what therapists are working
with right in their offices that are
looking at how people interact and they
want to influence a dynamic so we need a
dynamic analysis of data over time what
pushes the interaction in one direction
versus another
so because we get data over time we get
behavior perception and physiology all
integrated over time very much like that
Dow Jones Industrial Average
we can create the continent moral of
equations and so James Murray who is the
far
of mathematical biology and I work
together and because we're not very
intelligent it took us 15 years to get
these equations but when you look at
them you'll see they're obvious so what
we're trying to do is predict what
happens at time t plus 1 in this graph
of the husband's interaction the wife's
interaction and by the way this holds
for same-sex couples as well we say wife
and husband only because it's a little
bit more convenient to talk about it but
can we go for what's happening in this
graph of behavior or physiology or
perception at one time and predict at a
later time and in fact we can develop
these equations so on the left of the
equal sign we see the wife at time t
plus 1 in the equation above and on the
bottom the husband's so how do we
predict what's going to happen next
that's what we want to know that's what
the therapist wants to know well we have
one parameter and it's denoted a and B
and that's the old star dot right how
they start the conversation before they
start influencing one another is really
critical and so that's the theory that
the way they start up the way the wife
starts up that one constant is very very
important in predicting what's going to
happen next
but then there's another parameter which
is R 1 and R 2 and that predicts how
much emotional inertia a person has so
some people when they get angry boy they
stay angry a long time it's hard to move
them they're kind of like a Mack truck
we're going downhill and in the physics
that's called inertia right it takes a
lot of energy to move them off course
other people are more like a feather and
the wind they have low inertia right
well they have no stability either so
what's the right inertia well we don't
know but that's another parameter their
emotional inertia that affects how much
influence the partner can have which is
our third parameter the influence
function so when the wife's equation
there's the husband and the husband's
equation there's the wife well we can
actually specify with the theory
what that influence function
might look like so here's a husband
along the horizontal axis and the
vertical axis is his influence on the
wife so there are some points but we
need a theory that helps us find the
best fit to the data right so our theory
really said well on maybe it looks like
this there's one part of it when he's
being positive he's being nice to her
what's the impact of that the steepness
of the slope tells us what the impact of
positive emotions are like affection
humor and then the other one is how
influential is he was negativity with
anger disappointment with hurt feelings
with sadness and that slope gives us our
idea of the influence that positive and
negative emotions have but then we
thought well maybe when they get to a
certain threshold on that we have
denoted by K sub R maybe what happens is
they can repair and so that are the part
of the curve tells us when does repair
cut in and how effective is and what we
discover is that if you repair early in
the conversation you're much more
effective than if you wait okay that's
that was a kind of a surprising finding
and on the other hand what about
positive effect maybe you could amplify
or diminish positive effect and it turns
out yes you can by turning toward your
partner when your partner needs your
attention or interest the positive
effect can be either you know by turning
away diminished or by turning toward
amplified so these are the parameters in
our theory but now we do a very cool
thing we actually can create a portrait
of the couple's interaction a dynamic
portrait of how it unfolds over time and
what we do is we put the husband's
positive and negative behavior on the
horizontal axis and the wife's on the
vertical axis going up is positive going
down as negative that gives us quadrants
one two three and four
and we can describe it by two bunnies on
the beach in Quadrant labeled one and
two bunnies in the storm in Quadrant
three so we really want our couples to
be two bunnies on the beach rather than
two bunnies in a storm so gives us a new
goal of couples therapy right all right
so this face based portrait becomes very
clear this quadrant one is when they're
both positive and we have another
quadrant where they're both negative so
we'd like them to really not spend much
time in that quadrant or this quadrants
where one of them is positive and the
other is negative although it might be
good to be there because maybe one
counterbalance is the other so we don't
know yet so we have those quadrants to
look at as well okay there's our
relationship phase space now let's look
at an actual conversation and see how it
unfolds and there's a dot moving as the
couple talks to one another this is a
real conflict conversation a couple is
having and look at that dot moving all
over those quadrants in phase space so
now we see there's a dynamic unfolding
but it's kind of hard to see that thing
jumping all over the place and know
what's good and what's bad
we need the equations and we need to
know what's making that dot move what's
actually compelling that dot to move is
there some attractive force kind of like
gravitation is there an attractive force
that has maybe the power of Jupiter to
pull them toward the negative attractor
in which case the relationship will be
in a lot of trouble or is there a
positive attractor that puts them in
quadrant one that is powerful or is it
weak and the therapists really needs to
help make that much more powerful so
here's our old friend the startup now
this couple is starting in a positive
place right they're in quadrant number
one the positive positive quadrant and
there's a choice here they even move in
that direction toward that star that
blue star which is the attractor
in the face base that pulls their
interaction toward a positive place
especially if it's strong or they might
move the other way they might actually
cycle around another attractor that's
there that moves them in the negative
negative quadrant and that's our bunnies
in a storm and we don't want them there
or we don't want them to spend very much
occupation time in that place and the
attractors are the forces that make the
dot move so we're looking at not just a
graph and face space but we're looking
at a flow diagram almost like a fluid
flowing and you've seen this kind of
faith-based diagram with hurricanes
Hurricane Emma this comes from that
hurricane where the dot is moving right
and there's a force moving it toward an
attractor up there and we can actually
do the same thing with a couples
interaction so okay that's a theory for
getting a dynamical picture does it work
well this is what a stable unhappy
marriage looks like look at all the
flows look at the arrows and what are
they flowing toward a negative attractor
for our bunnies in a storm right we
don't like that you know and well what
about divorced couples well it turns out
with divorced couples you get this
picture there are three attractors in
that negative negative quadrant and one
is unstable
the one between the two stars and and
the two stars are unstable so what we
get there is turbulence
not only is there flow toward the
negative negative quadrant but a lot of
energy is expended as they move from one
attractor to the other at turbulence is
probably what predicts divorce versus
being in a stable unhappy marriage now I
don't know which is worse but they are
different but the real test is what
about good relationships happy stable
relationships how do they look and it
turns out when you put this together
with real data you get this picture
so yes it's true happy stable
relationships have a positive attract
they're very very simple face based
diagram and no matter where they start
the conversation where that startup is
they'll go toward it toward a positive
place which is kind of amazing
that's the dynamics of a good
relationship so we did it we actually
were able to describe mathematically the
dynamics now here's another thing you
can do with the math with the math we
can simulate any couple under imagined
conditions in other words we can do
thought experiments we can do
experiments by changing the parameters
and mathematically we can select the
best intervention to help a couple just
using math so for example here's a
couple and when you see on the left of
these sliders where we can change every
parameter in the math equation right we
can change their start up we can change
the emotional inertia we can change the
repair threshold how much they repair
when they repair and here we see you
know the green lines that that show us
the influence functions and the arrows
that show us the face based portrait the
flow so let's take a look at an actual
couple and here we see our this couple
are two bunnies in the storm they have
that negative attractor and we can
actually move the sliders to say what
would they look like
if their startup was just more positive
so we move in this thought experiment we
move the couple to a more positive place
by changing those parameters to start up
and then we take a look at what the
result is of the math and look there are
two bunnies on the beach there in that
positive positive quadrant and then all
we need is a technology for changing
startup which we have so we've created
the technology for changing these
parameters and now the therapist can
change their startups and then they get
the magic research findings are that the
magic does require this powerful trio of
physiological calm trust and commitment
and we know how to build it so science
did it when the magic is there we find
that we
at five to one ratio now we can
understand the magic because we're the
positive attractor no matter where the
conversation begins it would be drawn to
the positive positive quadrant
we'll get the five to one ratio Yahoo
there's the magic okay
so just to summarize what we've really
said is love relationships are important
we can assess their strengths and
challenges scientifically there is magic
and love that lasts forever we know that
and the five to one ratio indexes it we
have strong prediction but we can
mathematically model the magic the magic
requires calm trust and commitment and
maybe we can help avoid disaster and
help couples find their magic which is
turning out to be true in randomized
clinical trials so perhaps now the magic
of great love is a bit less of a mystery
thank you
