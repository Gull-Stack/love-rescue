DR. JOHN GOTTMAN: Is this good...
a good distance from the microphone?
Well, 35 years ago,
I started doing some research
with my best friend, Bob Levenson...
who also wound up being best man at our wedding.
And 35 years ago, Bob and I got together because
our relationships with women
weren't working very well.
[audience laughs]
So unlike the self-appointed gurus you'll see
on afternoon television
we really didn't know anything about
how to get along with women.
And so we started this research really hoping that
eventually we'd learn something that would help us
in our relationships.
And we really had no hypotheses.
I always think about
Isaac Newton — the great physicist — who once said,
"Non fingo hypotheses."
"I do not feign hypotheses."
So I thought that was pretty good as a start.
And so Bob and I really brought to the field
of the study of relationships
a colossal ignorance
and awareness of our ignorance.
So we started doing research by
building a laboratory where
couples could come at the end of the day
and just talk about how their day went
after they'd been apart for about eight hours.
While they were talking to each other
Bob Levenson had a computer that
...in the 1970s, was able to synchronize
the video timecode to the
physiological data we collected.
So as couples talked to each other
we were measuring, simultaneously, their heart rates...
...their blood velocity at various parts of their body...
...how much they were sweating from
the palms of their hands...
...we even put a little meter under their chairs
called the "Jiggle-O-Meter"
[audience laughs]
to measure how much they jiggled around.
And why did we do these things?
We had no idea.
We just thought it'd be kinda fun.
[audience laughs]
We had couples talk about an area of
continuing disagreement
— a conflict that they had —
and then a positive topic.
Then we showed them their video tapes
and asked them to turn a dial
that told us what they were feeling.
And we interviewed them about specific moments
that we didn't understand at the time.
Asking them what they were thinking and feeling
during these moments
and when I came to the University of Washington
about 23 years ago
I built an apartment laboratory
which was sort of like
a bed-and-breakfast getaway setting
on the medical school campus
and it's on the Montlake Cut
where all these beautiful boats were going by.
We tried to make it as much as we could
like a bed-and-breakfast getaway.
Except there were three cameras bolted to the wall
[audience laughs]
and the couples wore two-channels
— a Holter monitor —
measuring two channels of electrocardiogram.
And when they urinated
we took a urine sample
to measure stress hormones
and we took blood from them to look
at the immune system
and people were coding their facial expressions
in the control room.
But aside from that, it was a very relaxed...
[audience laughs]
...bed-and-breakfast kind of setting.
And, uh...
you know, about 20 years into this research,
my friend, Bob, came to the
University of Washington to give a talk
and a professor I was collaborating with
asked a question.
He was a researcher
— Neil Jacobsen —
who did research on couples therapy
And he said, "Well how can all this research help couples?"
And Bob said,
"I'm proud to say in the 20 years that
John and I have been working together
we've never helped anybody."
[audience laughs]
And that was true, we were really getting paid
to watch couples deteriorate
[audience laughs]
and making a living at it.
[audience laughs]
So we really did a series of research studies
trying to look at the "masters" of relationships
the ones who really stayed together,
didn't get divorced,
and were pretty happy, more or less.
And the "disasters" of relationships
— the ones that broke apart —
and the ones that stayed together
and weren't happy as well.
Bob and I also studied gay and lesbian committed relationships for a dozen years
in this 35 year period.
We really were able to study couples across
the whole life course.
In fact, we're just completing a study
in the Bay Area now that
we started 20 years ago
with two groups of couples,
a group of couples in their 40s and a group of couples in their 60s.
And our oldest subjects are now in their late 80s.
So we're just finishing this.
Across the whole life course
we've looked at transitions to becoming parents,
what happens when a baby arrives in the relationship,
how does it affect the relationship?
How do relationships affect babies?
Can we predict anything about child development?
And we found, to our great surprise,
that we could predict
as we followed couples over many, many years
with over 90% accuracy, what would
happen to a marriage
by just observing couples in our laboratory.
And I think nobody was as surprised
by these findings as Bob and I were.
Because at the time, psychologists really weren't very good at predicting human behavior
— individual behavior —
and the people who were on our tenure and promotions committee
really said to us,
"If you can't predict one person's behavior,
how can you predict two people?"
"You'll square the amount of uncertainty."
But it turns out that relationships have
an enormous amount of stability.
So that, even from the first three minutes of a conflict discussion a couple is having,
we can predict, 96% of the time, how the entire conversation will go.
And from the conversation, we can predict with high accuracy,
whether a couple will get divorced or not,
how happy they'll be,
and, in fact, one of my graduate students,
Alyson Shapiro,
who studied couples in their last trimester of pregnancy
was able to predict the child's temperament
and the child's neurological development
and reduce 50% of the uncertainty in looking at the first three years of the baby's life.
Just by looking at how the parents argued
in the last trimester.
So we found an enormous amount of predictability.
And what I'd like to do in the short time I have available
is to just go through giving you an idea
of what we learned
and how we understand this.
I think that Bob and I were kind of like the early astronomers who looked at the heavens
and tried to see patterns in the motions
of stars and planets.
And, indeed, there were patterns
that could be understood
that the early astronomers looked at.
And Ptolemy, of course, is known for
over a thousand years, having been able
to predict lunar eclipses
and very accurately predict the placement of stars
and the planets and the moon.
But he didn't know why
he didn't understand why it worked that way.
Except to say that
as Aristotle said,
"The heavenly planets must move in a perfect circle,"
which turned out not to be true.
It wasn't until Isaac Newton that we started
really getting theory.
So I want to take you through
knowing our 35 years of research
in which our first question was,
"Could we find any patterns
that discriminated the masters
from the disasters of relationships?"
And second,
"What theory could we develop
to understand those patterns?"
And only when we developed that theory
were we able to design interventions to help people.
And so these are all scientifically-based interventions
that my wife, Julie Gottman,
Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman
and I designed together.
She's the one who's really concerned
about helping people.
So...
that's what led to The Gottman Institute.
I've interviewed her about it to try to find out why that was so interesting to her.
So let me tell you how we were able to discriminate
the masters from the disasters of relationships.
One of the basic things that
when I was in graduate school
there was a book that came out called,
"The Intimate Enemy."
It was written up by a guy named George Bach.
And his idea for helping marriages was that
the problem in marriages, he said, was that
people didn't air their resentments.
So he had partners face one another
and take turns telling one another what they resented about each other.
He even designed these foam-rubber bats
that he manufactured called, "batakas,"
and they would take turns whacking each other
with one of the bats
"I really resent you didn't take out the garbage!"
Whack!
And then,
"I really resent that we don't have sex anymore!"
Whack!
And they'd go back and forth.
And that was kind of the state of the art when I was in graduate school.
[audience laughs]
And...
After hundreds of research studies
we've now learned that
when you do that, people leave more resentful than when they came in.
[audience laughs]
There is no catharsis effect for anger and resentment.
And basically what Bob and I found was that
what discriminated the disasters from the masters of relationships
was that the masters were really very gentle
with one another.
Even when they raised an issue.
They raised as if it was kind of an invisible soccer ball
that they were kicking around together.
They took responsibility for even
a small part of the problem
whereas the disasters really pointed
their finger at their partner
and were critical.
And their attitude was that they were
kind of diagnosing their partner's personality defects
and wanted to be really appreciated
for that by their partner.
And...
[audience laughs]
and they were hoping that their partner would respond by saying,
"Thank you for pointing out all the ways in which I am failing as a human being."
[audience laughs]
"Can we have lunch next Tuesday so we can talk about this some more?"
"You are such a wise person, John."
You know, "Thank you so much."
