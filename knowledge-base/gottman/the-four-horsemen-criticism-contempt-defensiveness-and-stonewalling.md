"You're so selfish!"
"Ugh, what an idiot."
"It's not my fault we're always late."
"Forget it..."
NARRATOR: Criticism, contempt,
defensiveness, and stonewalling.
Dr. John Gottman calls these negative communication patterns
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse."
Because they'll lead to the end of your relationship.
In fact, he can predict this relationship failure
with over 90% accuracy if the behavior isn't changed.
So, what can you do?
At The Gottman Institute, we understand you might not even know you're communicating this way
or you might not know how to control it.
But if you practice the following four
research-based antidotes...
...there is hope for your future.
Criticism attacks the character of the recipient
instead of focusing on a specific behavior.
The antidote to criticism is to talk about
your feelings using "I" statements.
Then express a positive need.
Contempt is an expression of superiority
that comes out as sarcasm, cynicism, name-calling...
...eye rolling, sneering, mockery, and hostile humor.
Contempt is the greatest predictor of relationship failure
and must be eliminated.
The antidote to contempt is to treat
one another with respect
and build a culture of appreciation within the relationship.
Defensiveness is self-protection through righteous indignation
or playing the victim.
Defensiveness never solves the problem
and is really just an underhanded way
of blaming your partner.
The antidote to defensiveness
is to accept responsibility
...even if only for part of the conflict.
Stonewalling occurs when the listener withdraws
from the conversation without resolving anything.
It takes time for the negativity
created by the first three Horsemen
to result in stonewalling.
But when it does, it can become a habit.
The antidote to stonewalling is to
break for at least 20 minutes, calm down,
then return to the conversation.
Spare your relationship from certain destruction.
