ever wonder why some couples make it and
others don't
scientist dr. John Gottman did he spent
40 years studying thousands of couples
to find out exactly what separates the
relationship masters from the
relationship disasters
Shakespeare compared love to a robust
Gottman uses a different metaphor an
emotional bank account you know how a
regular bank account works so what's an
emotional bank account it represents the
positive and negative balance in your
relationship the best couples maintain a
high balance couples that break up are
often in the red you make deposits
through positive interactions and you
withdraw through negative ones what does
a deposit look like it's a simple act of
showing your partner that you care for
and support them it's as easy as sending
your partner a good luck text before a
meeting or cooking them dinner after a
long day and pay attention when your
partner shows you their admiration and
support notice when they're investing in
your relationship a withdrawal is either
hurtful behavior toward your partner or
ignoring their invitations to connect
but withdrawals and deposits don't have
equal weight in fact Gottman found it
takes 5 positive interactions to make up
for one negative one
happy couples maintain at least this
five to one ratio if you make constant
deposits and keep your balance high
you're saving up for a rainy day when
you'll need to cash in on that goodwill
Gottman notes that small daily deposits
like asking your partner how their day
was is far more important than the
occasional over-the-top romantic gesture
positivity leads to more positivity this
is not about keeping score it's about
investing in your relationship and your
shared emotional bank account moving
from me to a week so keep your balance
high by doing nice things every day and
recognizing when your partner does them
for you you'll build up that emotional
bank account in no time
