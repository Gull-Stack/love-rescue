when we studied how couples brought up
problems you know on videotape these
3,000 couples what we saw was that they
followed basically three
rules three typical behaviors for
couples who made it work who made
lasting relationships here's what they
did step one they always started with I
and it was usually I'm upset or I'm
worried or I'm angry so it was I plus
some kind of feeling and you know if
they didn't know you know they didn't
know from feelings what feeling is what
feel which one they just say I'm upset
because again as I mentioned earlier
upset covers everything so they'd say
I'm upset and then about what step two
is about what and the about what part
was really interesting because they
wouldn't
say I'm upset that you're such an idiot
they wouldn't do that they wouldn't go
blaming right they would say something
that was again more factual they talk
about the facts I'm upset that the
garbage hasn't been taken out I'm angry
that there's a new dent in the car I'm
furious so they could be angry anger was
okay I'm furious that the the bills
haven't been
paid okay so they were not describing
their
partner they were describing themselves
and then describing the situation that
they were upset about that's that was
the trick and finally the third step is
that they would say what they
needed how could their partner make it
better how could their partner Shine for
them so they said what they needed I
need you to take out the garbage I need
you to drive more carefully so our car
will be
protected so they would say what they
needed and I know that that's something
that's really really hard for us
especially in this culture because after
all we're all individuals we're all
self-sufficient we don't need anybody
from any you know nothing we need
nothing right ha haa we are all pack
animals as little human beings and we do
need each other that's the reality we
die if we don't have connection with
other people you take infants and
isolate them they die you can give them
all the food and water they need they
will die we need touch we need
connection
we need each other that's just the
reality there's no such thing as too
needy no such
thing everybody has needs that's who we
are that's how we're built
