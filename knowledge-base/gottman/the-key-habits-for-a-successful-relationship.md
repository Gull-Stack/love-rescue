the common habits that really lead to
successful
relationships are what we call first of
all love mapping and love mapping means
asking your partner open-ended questions
about their internal World those sound
like what are your needs today how can I
help you or something like um how are
you thinking about your job how are you
thinking about your job you feeling
about being a grandmother oh boy I like
that one yeah yeah so you know questions
that really elicit your partner's
internal world and what you're doing is
it's almost like you're composing a map
of what's going on inside your partner
what's stressing you out right now who
are your best friends you know we ask
questions when we're first dating to get
to know somebody but then when we stay
together we get really busy we might
have kids or busy jobs and we stop
asking questions right right yeah so so
asking questions is one thing that
really really
helps
another turning toward our partner's
bids for connection so in very small
moments people are kind of trying to get
their partner interested in them and if
you notice those bids for connection and
respond to them you're really building
an emotional bank account in the
relationship which is very important
yeah so a bit for connection can be
something really simple like looking out
the window and seeing a beautiful bird
in the tree and say hey honey look at
that bird and your partner comes over
and says huh yeah that's all it takes
it's a very small little step but it
makes a huge difference we found in our
apartment lab where we conducted some of
the research that couples who were
successful turn turn towards each
other's bids for connection 86% of the
time couples who didn't work out only
33% of the time so you can hear what a
huge difference that step makes another
is expressing affection and respect the
fondness and admiration system we call
in small moments often really turning to
your partner and catching your partner
doing something right and appreciating
it that's right so saying thank thank
you if your partner makes you coffee
even if they do it every morning like
this guy I thank him every morning for
making me coffee it's been going on for
38 years so I've said it a lot of times
but still it has meaning every single
day or saying God you know you are the
most intelligent person I loved what you
said about this topic things like that
compliments that you give to your
partner are so appreciated and they make
a big difference we think that if we say
I love you in the beginning of the
relationship we don't have to do it
anymore wrong all of us have you know a
little insecurity inside ourselves does
our partner still love us even after all
these years all these changes we've gone
through so it's really important to keep
expressing that love to one another as a
reassurance and as a really sweet tender
moment between you another is having a
positive of mind which means that you're
really scanning your social environment
for things you can appreciate and you
know and are grateful for rather than
having a habit of Mind where you're
scanning your social environment for
your partner's mistakes and nurturing
disappointment in your partner so that
positive habit of Mind turns out to be
very important in relationships that
were successful Robinson and price
discovered that people really see all of
the positive things that their partner
is doing whereas in unhappy
relationships they actually miss 50% of
the positivity that their partner is
actually doing in an evening so in a
nutshell what that means is look for
what your partner is doing right and say
thank you right it makes a huge
difference yeah and then we move on next
to how a couple handles
conflict that that turns out to be very
that's a big one so I guess are we going
through all the seven principles here I
think we are yeah okay all right so with
Conflict Management there are several
things that are super super important
first of all how do you bring up a
problem that is between you in the
relationship how do you bring up a
complaint well you don't do it with
criticism by negatively describing your
partner like saying God you are such a
slob why don't you ever clean up the
kitchen instead
you describe yourself and the situation
and then say what your positive need is
so let me break that down a little bit
so by describing your feelings first it
may sound something like this I'm
unhappy I'm angry annoyed I'm sad I'm
nervous that's step one all those
feelings about what so you're not saying
about you and here's how you're bad that
doesn't work that's criticism instead
what you're doing is saying about the
situation the bills haven't been paid
yet and that's making me feel nervous
hear the difference you're describing a
situation or you can say you know I
walked into the kitchen and I felt
really annoyed because there were still
dishes in the sink there you go that's
the situation and then what is your
positive need and what we mean by a
positive need is is how can you shine
for me how can you do something that
will make me feel better rather than
just expressing you know your resentment
so that might sound like I'm really
upset that the kitchen is a mess would
you please clean it up tonight before
dinner not so hard right so we call that
gentle startup rather than harsh startup
which is pointing your finger at your
partner and being critical or even
demeaning belittling your partner being
contemptuous so gentle startup is a big
part of soften startup soften startup
making making the conflict really much
more collaborative that way right so
you're both working on a
situation right that's creating some
feelings in okay after you bring up the
issue and your
partner listens hopefully without
feeling put down or criticized what can
really be helpful especially with bigger
issues or Perpetual issues is this you
ask your partner six really important
questions that we discovered tap what's
deep inside your partner regarding that
issue and those six questions are things
like what are your ethics or beliefs
that are part of your position on this
issue do you have some childhood history
or personal history that's part of your
position on this what were all your
feelings why is this so important to you
do you have hidden dream an ideal dream
behind your position on the issue right
ideally how would you like the world to
be regarding this issue and finally the
last one is is there some underlying
purpose or goal for you in this so what
those questions do and by by the way
each of you takes a turn asking the
questions of the other and then
answering them so you're both getting a
chance to explain your
positions what happens is that the whole
world around this issue really opens up
you understand why this is so important
to your partner what the background is
to this you know let me take an example
if it's parenting style right and one of
you really believe beles in spanking
your child if they do some misbehavior
and you really do not believe in that
well when you find out the background
history for you it might be something
like you know I got spanked and it
really hurt and it made me afraid of my
parents it didn't help me change my
behavior it just made me fearful of them
so I started going behind their back to
do
stuff the other person might say you
know I got spanked too but I think it it
really helped me it wasn't a big deal it
was fine and it worked I changed my
behavior so you know when you hear the
different backgrounds the different
reasoning behind for each of you why
something is so
important understanding takes place more
compassion for your partner takes place
and that's the goal of conflict Mutual
understanding right that's right and
there's two more to go one of them is
honoring each other's dreams so what
does that mean you know we're not
talking about nighttime dreams we're
talking about my God I dream about going
back to
school yeah or I want to start my own
business or I dream about not being in
business and retiring I want to travel
the world a I want to go to Antarctica
right dreams you honor each other's
dreams you know whether you actually
particip at in them together with your
partner or not it's something that you
work to understand and why it has so
much meaning for your partner and then
you do whatever you can to support that
dream right and
finally creating shared meaning now let
me just mention something every single
one of you no matter what your education
no matter what your IQ none of that
matters every single person is a
philosopher every single person looks
for meaning in their lives what gives
them a reason to live to go on to have
some kind of purpose for their existence
on this earth
right do you share that with your
partner and by share I don't mean does
your partner feel the same way no I mean
does your partner listen when you
describe your own personal sense of
meaning it's about sharing talking about
what's meaningful for you and what's
meaningful for your partner which means
you understand your partner again kind
of like love mapping and their internal
world at a much deeper level what really
gives them a reason to exist you know
there's almost more not as important a
question as that one for all of us so
sharing that information with your
partner really creates a deeper
connection right and the two really
important pillars that make all this
work are trust and commitment and Trust
really means thinking for two and
maximizing both people's benefits in
every action or decision that you take
so you know your partner's got your back
because your partner's really thinking
about your benefits not just their own
benefits and commitment is really about
saying this is the love of my life and
my partner is irreplaceable and I
cherish what I have rather than having a
habit of Mind where you denigrate what
your partner doesn't have and nurture
resentment for what's missing so
commitment is a very important part of
this whole
equation right thrust in commitment
everything else follows those right
