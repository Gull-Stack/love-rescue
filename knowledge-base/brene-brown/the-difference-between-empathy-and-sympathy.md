so what is empathy and why is it very
different than sympathy empathy fuels
connection sympathy drives disconnection
empathy it's very interesting Teresa
wisman is a nursing scholar who studied
professions very diverse professions
where empathy is relevant and came up
with four qualities of empathy
perspective taking the ability to take
the perspective of another person or or
recognize their perspective as their
truth staying out of judgment not easy
when you enjoy it as much as most of us
do recognizing emotion in other people
and then communicating that empathy is
feeling with people and to me I always
think of empathy as this kind of Sacred
Space when someone's kind of in a deep
hole and they shout out from the bottom
and they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm
overwhelmed and then we look and we say
hey climb down I know what it's like
down here and you're not alone sympathy
is
oo it's bad
uh-huh uh no you want a
sandwich
um empathy is a choice and it's a
vulnerable choice because in order to
connect with you I have to connect with
something in myself that knows that
feeling rarely if ever does an empathic
response begin with at
least I had a yeah and we do it all the
time because you know what someone just
shared something with us that's
incredibly painful and we're trying to
Silver Lining it I don't think that's a
verb but I'm using it as one we're
trying to put the Silver Lining around
it so I had a miscarriage oh at least
you know you can get pregnant I think my
marriage is falling apart at least you
have a
marriage John's getting kicked out of
school at least Sarah is an a student
but one of the things we do sometimes in
the face of very difficult
conversations is we try to make things
better if I share something with you
that's very difficult I'd rather you
say I don't even know what to say right
now I'm just so glad you told me
because the truth is rarely can a
response make something better what
makes something better is connection
