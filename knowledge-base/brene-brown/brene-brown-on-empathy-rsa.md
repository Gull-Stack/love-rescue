so what is empathy and why is it very
different than sympathy empathy fuels
connection sympathy drives disconnection
empathy it's a very interesting Teresa
Wiseman is a nursing scholar who studied
professions very diverse professions
where empathy is relevant and came up
with four qualities of empathy
perspective-taking
the ability to take the perspective of
another person or recognize their
perspective as their truth staying out
of judgment not easy when you enjoy it
as much as most of us do recognising
emotion and other people and then
communicating that empathy is feeling
with people and to me I always think of
empathy as this kind of sacred space
when someone's kind of in a deep hole
and they shout out from the bottom and
they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm
overwhelmed and then we look and we say
hey calm down I know it what it's like
down here and you're not alone sympathy
is oh it's bad uh-huh
no you want a sandwich if if he is a
choice and it's a vulnerable choice
because in order to connect with you I
have to connect with something in myself
that knows that feeling rarely if ever
does an empathic response begin with at
least I had it yeah and we do it all the
time because you know what someone just
shared something with us that's
incredibly painful and we're trying to
silver lining it I don't think that's a
verb but I'm using it as one we're
trying to put this a little running
around it so I had a miscarriage at
least you know you can get pregnant I
think my marriage is falling apart at
least you have a marriage
John's getting kicked out of school at
least Sarah is an A student but one of
the things we do sometimes in the face
of very difficult conversations is we
try to make things better if I share
something with you that's very difficult
I'd rather you say I don't even know
what to say right now I'm just so glad
you told me because the truth is rarely
can a response make something better
what makes something better is
connection
