how many of you are blamers how many of
you when something goes wrong the first
thing you want to know is whose fault it
is hi my name is bernee I am a blamer
let me tell you this quick story so this
is a couple years ago when I first
realized the magnitude to which I blame
I'm in my house I have on white slacks
and a pink sweater set and I'm drinking
a cup of coffee in my kitchen
it's a full cup of coffee I drop it on
the tile floor it goes into a million
pieces splashes up all over me and the
first I mean a millisecond after it hit
the floor right out of my mouth is this
damn you
Steve who is my
husband because let me tell you how fast
this works for
me so Steve plays water polo with a
group of friends and the night before he
went to go play water polo
and I said hey make sure you come back
at 10:00 cuz you know I can never fall
asleep into your home and he got back
like at 10:30 and so I went to bed a
little bit later than I thought Argo my
second cup of coffee that I probably
would not be having had he come home
when we discussed
therefore and so the rest of that story
is I'm cleaning up um the
kitchen Steve calls caller ID I'm like
hey he's like hey what's going on
babe what's going on
um so I'll tell you exactly what's going
on I'm cleaning up the coffee that
spilled
all like dial
tone cuz he knows how many of you go to
that place when something bad happens
the first thing you want to know is
whose fault is
it I'd rather it be my fault than no
one's fault because why why because it
gives us some semblance of control
but here if you enjoy blaming this is
where you should stick your fingers in
your ear and do the n n n n thing
because I'm getting ready to ruin it for
you because here's what we know from the
research blame is simply the
discharging of discomfort and pain it
has an inverse relationship with
accountability accountability by
definition is a vulnerable
process it means me calling you and
saying hey my feelings were really hurt
about this and talking it's not blaming
blaming is simply a way that we
discharge anger people who blame a lot
seldom have the tenacity and grit to
actually hold people accountable because
we expend all of our energy raging for
15 seconds and figuring out whose fault
something
is and blaming is very corrosive in
relationships and it's one of the
reasons we miss our opportunities for
empathy because when something happens
and we're hearing a
story we're not really listening we're
in the place where I was making the
connections as quickly as we can about
whose fault something was
