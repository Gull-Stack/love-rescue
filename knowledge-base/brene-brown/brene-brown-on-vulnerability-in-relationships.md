so I think the biggest myth about
vulnerability is that it's weakness I
think a lot of people were raised to
believe that it was modeled I think
certainly in our culture um we see that
a lot that to be vulnerable to be open
to be exposed is to be weak um and the
truth is you know what I found in my
research is that vulnerability is not
weakness in fact I would argue that it's
our greatest measure of Courage when we
went out and asked people what is
vulnerability we heard things like
vulnerability is the first date after my
divorce vulnerability is starting my own
company vulnerability is taking
responsibility for something that went
wrong at work vulnerability is sitting
with my wife who has stage three breast
cancer and making plans for our young
kids um vulnerability is taking my
business public you know the definition
I use in my work of vulnerability is
simply uncertainty risk and emotional
exposure vulnerability is about the
willingness to show up and to be seen
even when there are no
guarantees and it's interesting to me I
mean one of the things that I thought
was really interesting I gave a talk um
it's probably a couple years now and it
was being translated by people doing
American Sign Language and they came up
before the talk started they said are
there any words that you're going to use
a lot in your talk that we should you
know know about that are might be
different I said well I use the word
vulnerability a lot and they kind of
there were two of them they kind of
looked at each other and they said oh we
we do this for vulnerability
and I said what does that mean they said
it means weaken the knees and I'm like
wow that's not how I talk about
vulnerability and she said well there's
only one other sign for vulnerability
and I said what is it and she
said and I said oh that's what I'm
talking about and so to
me vulnerability is our most accurate
measure of Courage I mean it's pretty
powerful when I have 13,000 pieces of
data collected over 12 years that I
cannot find a single incident or story
of courage
that was not completely underpinned by
vulnerability I think the problem arises
that it's there's so many little
paradoxes with vulnerability and one of
them is that vulnerability
is courage in you but weakness in me
when I meet you it's the first thing I
look for in you but it's the last thing
I want to show you in me and so I
think to really put ourselves out there
knowing that if we do that enough we're
going to fail I just don't think it gets
more courageous than that
