 So, what is empathy and why is it 
 VERY different than sympathy? 
 Empathy fuels connection. 
 Sympathy drives disconnection. 
 It's very interesting. 
 Theresa Wiseman is a nursing scholar 
 who studied very diverse professions 
 where empathy is relevant 
 and came up with 
 four qualities of empathy. 
 Perspective taking - ability to take 
 the perspective of another person, 
 or recognise their perspective 
 as their truth. 
 Staying out of judgment - 
 not easy when you enjoy it 
 as much as most of us do. 
 (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES) 
 Recognising emotion in other people, 
 then communicating that. 
 Empathy is feeling WITH people. 
 I always think of empathy 
 as this kind of sacred space. 
 When someone's in a deep hole 
 and they shout from the bottom... 
 ..And we look and we say, "Hey!" 
 And climb down... 
 Sympathy is, "Ooh!" 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 "It's bad, uh-huh?" 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 "Uh... No. You want a sandwich?" 
 Empathy is a choice 
 and it's a vulnerable choice. 
 In order to connect with you, 
 I have to connect with something 
 in myself that knows that feeling. 
 Rarely, if ever, does an empathic 
 response begin with, "At least..." 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Yeah. And we do it all the time 
 because, you know what? 
 Someone shared something with us 
 that's incredibly painful 
 and we're trying 
 to "silver lining" it. 
 I don't think that's a verb, 
 but I'm using it as one. 
 We're trying to put a silver lining 
 around it. 
 So, "I had a miscarriage." 
 "At least you know 
 you can get pregnant." 
 "I think my marriage 
 is falling apart." 
 "At least you have a marriage." 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 "John's getting kicked out 
 of school." 
 "At least Sarah is an A-student." 
 One of the things we do sometimes 
 in the face of very difficult 
 conversations 
 is we try to make things better. 
 If I share something with you that's 
 very difficult, I'd rather you say, 
 "I don't even know what to say. 
 I'm just so glad you told me." 
 Because the truth is, rarely can 
 a response make something better. 
 What makes something better 
 is connection.
