I was an FBI hostage negotiator it
sounds like a cry for help doesn't it
there were more people working in a
federal building I worked in in New York
City than a small town in Iowa I grew up
in my mom is still trying to figure out
how all that happened my mom by the way
is a loving no-nonsense hard-working
Midwestern mom who says what she means
you know what the difference between
that kind of mom and a terrorist is you
can negotiate with a terrorist
you see they're as similar experiences
out there when you're an FBI hostage
negotiator you deal with the mad the
badness sad to quote Tom strands to
Godfather the FBI's hostage negotiation
program that means you believe you never
split the difference how you supposed to
split the difference with some bad guy
who's got four hostages he wants a jet
to Cuba in a million dollars you say all
right we'll take two hostages we'll give
you a helicopter to New Jersey and you
take an uber from there of course not
one of the myth I'd like to dispel about
hostage negotiators as well it said we
can say whatever we want to get our way
because these are one-off negotiations
and we're never gonna see the bad guy
again
well hostage negotiators have repeat
customers it was a siege in a major city
in the u.s. the bad guy was on a run for
ten days after having murdered four
people they finally get him cornered
he's got two hostages then Yoshida gets
on the phone with them the negotiators
little excited and the bad guy literally
says to him on the phone
you're not doing a good job you're
supposed to be establishing rapport with
me he'd been barricaded before if the
negotiator before woulda lied to him I
said what he had to say to get him out
of there lives have been lost on down
the line so we have repeat customers we
believe in reputation we have integrity
so
one night I welcome to bar with three
other hostage negotiators now I realize
that sounds like a joke for hostage to
go shooters walk into a bar and they
don't pay for anything but this actually
happened the four of us walked into the
bar and a place is packed it is jumping
and I walker I look around I see a seat
empty at the bar and I go over you're
ready to sit down it and then a guy
sitting next to the seat says don't even
think about it now I'm a hostage
negotiator I'm gonna talk to this guy so
I say why is that
he says cuz I'll kick your ass I say I'm
gonna need that I'm Chris and I hold out
my hand the other negotiators listen we
swoop in and they put the arms round and
say hey how you doing let us talk to you
you know what's going on let's see
what's going on we find out this guy's a
former Vietnam vet his life is in a
shambles it's a mess
no job no girlfriend he's out he
perceives the world of celebrating and
happy and he's miserable and that's why
the seats empty you know everybody tried
to sit down area offered to fight him
now I know from hostage negotiation
forget the hostage takers to use the
hostages name it makes it much much
harder for them to hurt
well I'm some nameless guy he's ready to
hit me soon as I become Chris everything
changes now how was I supposed to split
the difference with that guy anyway sit
on his lap sit under the chair alright
so what do you do if you're armed with
this tactical empathy from hostage
negotiation after you leave the FBI and
you're looking for gainful employment
how do you find a real job now you write
a book
I wrote the book never split the
difference with tall Roz and Brandon
bloss about applying the tactical
empathy from hostage negotiation to the
bullies and the liars who encounter
everyday to the bad the bad the sad we
run into in our jobs and our social
interactions that a family gathering at
the breakfast table
I saw meme recently I thought it was
really fun and said you know this parent
thing is really wearing me out I think
I'll try something less stressful like
being a hostage negotiator
Nicole empathy weapons-grade empathy did
you ever imagine hearing those two words
combined in the same sentence it never
split the difference we defined tactical
empathy is simply taking an inventory of
the perspective of the person you're
talking to to the adverse of the
adversary of the counterpart especially
the parts that we don't like and then
telling them what it is describing it
back to them calmly no denials no
disagreements calmly a tactical empathy
works because we all possess this human
nature wire it works on a human nature
level we've got something in our brains
called the limbic system everybody has
its components to the brain it doesn't
matter what your gender your ethnicity
or where you grew up you have a limbic
system and you everyone has that that's
the reason every hostage negotiation
team in the world Baghdad to Bogota to
Boston uses the same skills because the
human nature wiring that we all possess
now that's its shortcoming it only works
with people so I'll give you another
human nature secret insider's tip we all
have one way we tell the truth one way
we might lie five to seven different
ways but you've got one way you tell the
truth and that's the way a polygraph
works and way Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was
identified by two colleagues of mine as
a mastermind of 9/11 now the way a
polygraph works is you come inside they
sit you down they hook
- this machine they put all these wires
and these gauges on you and they ask you
a series of control questions - lay down
your one way of telling the truth you
know what day is it where are you what's
your name
what'd you have for breakfast they get
your baseline for truth-telling then
they ask you the hard questions the dog
really eat your homework we're really in
a bathroom when a fight broke out it
doesn't matter which of the many ways
you might come out of your truth telling
the only thing that matters is that you
came out of the truth-telling baseline
now a few months after 9/11 a secret
government agency had a terrorist in
custody in a secret location outside the
United States a terrace was badly
wounded and they were worried that he
was going to die and they needed to get
somebody in to interview him that knew
knew the substance of the case and two
colleagues of mine were the only ones
close by and the reason why they were
where this guy was gonna die move on to
the next life was the only reason that
they're gonna live let my colleagues
come and let FBI agents come in and talk
to him so they get together and I say
they've got a picture of the person they
know to be the organizer of 9/11 but the
pictures not good enough for them to be
able to tell exactly who it is so they
say we just talked to this guy long
enough till he knows we know what he
looks like when he tells the truth and
then we lay the picture on him see what
he says so he talked on the show him a
pitch and they say who is this and he
looks at me says you know who it is and
I don't know we don't it's why we're
asking
he says it's Ramsay's uncle Ramsay the
Ramsay he's talking about is ramzi
yousef who's in American prison doing
life and he's a mastermind of the first
World Trade Center attack back in
nineteen nineteen ninety-three Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed is his uncle in fact the
organizer of the 9/11 attack and the
interesting part about this at the time
as most of the US government doesn't
think Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is involved
with Al Qaeda at all let alone
organising the attack and that's how he
was identified with that human nature
truth now what's the point the point is
that even terrorists are humans and
their human nature rules that apply to
all of us all situations so several
years ago while I'm still with the FBI
I'm
at Harvard Law School's negotiation
course and I'm going to their
negotiation course because Harvard and
the FBI have the same definition of
empathy Bob manukan the head of their
program on negotiation says empathy is
just describing and demonstrating and
understanding the needs interest in
perspective of your counterpart without
necessarily agreeing and it goes on to
say it's not about liking or sympathy in
any way and I'm thinking I get behind
that how am I supposed to like a
terrorist's this is perfect in summon
substance the FBI on one hand and
Harvard on the other have the same
definition of empathy so while I'm up
there I'm looking for some more academic
scientific evidence that backs aside the
up of universal human nature wiring and
one of the brilliant instructors up
there Sheila Hien talks about a book
called the carts air and it's a study
and scientific proof that emotions are
intertwined in all of our decisions we
make our decisions based on what we care
about which makes decision-making by
definition of emotional process and I'm
thinking perfect Eureka's is exactly
what I'm looking for the only problem is
I have never heard of the philosopher
named Descartes so I write down dick
Hart D I seek a DI ck HEA RT dick Hart
and I go home and I google dick heart
and I can't find him anywhere
I'm thinking I don't know why she was so
pressed with this guy nobody ever heard
of dick hearts error is that he needs a
PR person so people know who that is
eventually though I do figure it out
I'll a story a friend a colleague a
client uses a transformative skill of
tactical empathy to cut million-dollar
deals in a tech sector he's enormous ly
successful he's at a family gathering
his youngest sisters had too much to
drink now his younger sister is a
primary caregiver of the dying father
and a stress on her is enormous and he's
seen her before these types of
gatherings lash out at other people when
she starts in on him
and he realizes now it's his turn he
sent me an email that said I just wanted
to make her feel heard and to not
dispute a thing that she said it went on
for an hour
the next day she sends him an email that
says yesterday I attacked you and he
showed me nothing but love thank you for
being my big brother ladies and
gentlemen the bad the madness a door
everywhere they're us
don't let just Terrace and bank robbers
be the beneficiary of this
transformative skill he's tactical
empathy and the people you talk to you
your adversaries time and the
counterparts turn them into loved ones
and never split the difference thank you
[Applause]
